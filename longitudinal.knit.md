What is **Longitudinal Data**?

- Repeated measures over time on subjects
- Different than other ways of repeated measures on clustered data (like family members, or kids in a classroom)
- Other similar data structures include time series data. Typically only have one subject (one stock market, sales from one product), and usually measured for a longer length of time. 
- **Key feature** is that longitudinal data is ordered over time, linear distance, or some other "meta-meter" such as trial number, dose or length. 

What can we learn from longitudinal data? 

- Population (average) response over time. 
- Population average response over time between different groups.
- How individual responses behave over time. 
- What is the estimate for the next observation over time? 
- How do covariates affect the population mean time trend and individual variation? 


The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: 

1. Introduce the **Pediatric Pain** experiment and explore the resulting data. 
2. See how we can visualize longitudinal data
3. Explore some analyses methods that are often conducted on longitudinal data.
    - There are many ways to parameterize the data and to make comparisons. 
4. Fitting a random intercept model on this data. 
5. Compare estimates between and across groups by writing contrast statements.
