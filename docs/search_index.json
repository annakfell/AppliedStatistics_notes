Consider physical symptoms such as a fever, cough, sore through etc. These are often observed characteristics of an underlying event such as a viral infection. Now, not all individuals express the same symptoms, or event the same severity of symptoms, but we would say that there is a strong correlation between symptoms and underlying disease. Factor analysis aims to understand the patterns of correlations between the underlying disease, and observed symptoms. "],

For more detail see the references mentioned in PMA6 Chapter 15.2 and the links in the Additional Resources section for more information. 13.1.1 Latent Constructs Latent variables are ones that cannot be measured directly; e.g. Depression, Anxiety, Mathematical ability. They drive how we would respond to various tasks and questions that can be measured; vocabulary, arithmetic, statistical reasoning. Factor Analysis aims to Generalize of principal components analysis Explain interrelationships among a set of variables Where we select a small number of factors to convey essential information Can perform additional analyses to improve interpretation 13.1.2 Comparison with PCA Similar in that no dependent variable PCA: Select a number of components that explain as much of the total variance as possible. FA: Factors selected mainly to explain the interrelationships among the original variables. Ideally, the number of factors expected is known in advance. Major emphasis is placed on obtaining easily understandable factors that convey the essential information contained in the original set of variables. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conceptual-distinction-between-factor-analysis-and-principal-component-analysis-ote-An_fig1_47386956 Mirror image of PCA Each PC is expressed as a linear combination of X’s Each \\(X\\) is expressed as a linear combination of Factors 13.1.3 EFA vs CFA Exploratory Factor Analysis Explore the possible underlying factor structure of a set of observed variables Does not impose a preconceived structure on the outcome.

["factor-model.html", "13.2 Factor Model", " 13.2 Factor Model Start with P standardized variables. That is \\(\\frac{(x_{i}-\\bar{x})}{s_{i}}\\). So for the rest of these FA notes, understand that each \\(X\\) written has already been standardized. Express each variable as (its own) linear combination of \\(m\\) common factors plus a unique factor \\(e\\). \\[ X_{1} = l_{11}F_{1} + l_{12}F_{2} + \\ldots + l_{1m}F_{m} + e_{1} \\\\ X_{2} = l_{21}F_{1} + l_{22}F_{2} + \\ldots + l_{2m}F_{m} + e_{1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{P} = l_{P1}F_{1} + l_{P2}F_{2} + \\ldots + l_{Pm}F_{m} + e_{P} \\] \\(m\\) is the number of common factors, typicall \\(m &lt;&lt; P\\). Somemtimes, \\(m\\) is known in advance. \\(X_{i} = \\sum l_{ij} F_{j}+ \\epsilon_{i}\\) \\(F_{j}\\) = common or latent factors. They are uncorreclated and each having mean 0 and variance 1 \\(l_{ij}\\) = coefficients of common factors = factor loadings \\(e_{i}\\) = unique factors relating to one of the original variables. \\(e_{i}\\)’s and \\(F_{j}\\)’s are uncorrelated 13.2.1 Components of Variance Recall that \\(x_{i}\\) is standardized, so \\(Var(X)=1\\). Since each response variable \\(x_{i}\\) is broken into two parts, so is the variance. communality: part due to common factors. Denoted as \\(h^{2}_{i}\\). specificity: part due to a unique factor. Denoted as \\(u^{2}_{i}\\). \\[ V(X_{i}) = h^{2}_{i} + u^{2}_{i} \\] If the number \\(m\\) of common factors is not known (EFA), it is recommended that you start with the default option available in the softare program. Often this is the number of factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. Since the results are highly dependent on \\(m\\), you should always try several factors to gain further insight into the data. 13.2.2 Two big steps The first step is to numerical find estimates of the loadings \\(l_{ij}\\), and the communalities \\(h^{2}_{i}\\). This process is called initial factor extraction. There are a number of methods to solve, we will explore three: principal components, iterated components, and maximum likelihood. The mathematical details of each are left in the textbook for interested readers. The second step is to obtain a new set of factors, called rotated factors which is done to improve interpretation. We will first explore these steps using simulated data. "],
