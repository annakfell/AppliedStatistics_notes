["binary-classification.html", "Chapter 10 Classification of Binary outcomes", " Chapter 10 Classification of Binary outcomes This section will be expanded to discuss classification for more than two groups. Sometimes Odds Ratios can be difficult to interpret or understand. Sometimes you just want to report the probability of the event occurring. Or sometimes you want to predict whether or not a new individual is going to have the event. For all of these, we need to calculate \\(p_{i} = P(y_{i}=1)\\), the probability of the event. Back solving the logistic model for \\(p_{i} = e^{\\beta X} / (1+e^{\\beta X})\\) gives us the probability of an event. \\[ p_{i} = \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1i} + \\beta_{2}x_{2i} + \\ldots + \\beta_{p}x_{pi}}} {1 + e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1i} + \\beta_{2}x_{2i} + \\ldots + \\beta_{p}x_{pi}}} \\] Consider the main effects model of depression on age, income and gender from section 9.3.2 Estimate Std.

It entirely depends on their covariate profile. In other words, what value X take on for each record. Let’s compare the probability of being depressed for males and females separately, while holding age and income constant at their average value. depress %&gt;% summarize(age=mean(age), income=mean(income)) ## age income ## 1 44.41497 20.57483 Plug the coefficient estimates and the values of the variables into the equation and calculate. \\[ P(depressed|Female) = \\frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(1)}} {1 + e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(1)}} \\] XB.f &lt;- -0.676 - 0.02096*(44.4) - .03656*(20.6) + 0.92945 exp(XB.f) / (1+exp(XB.f)) ## [1] 0.1930504 \\[ P(depressed|Male) = \\frac{e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(0)}} {1 + e^{-0.676 - 0.02096(44.4) - .03656(20.6) + 0.92945(0)}} \\] XB.m &lt;- -0.676 - 0.02096*(44.4) - .03656*(20.6) exp(XB.m) / (1+exp(XB.m)) ## [1] 0.08629312 The probability for a 44.4 year old female who makes $20.6k annual income has a 0.19 probability of being depressed.

["calculating-predictions.html", "10.1 Calculating predictions", " 10.1 Calculating predictions So what if you want to get the model predicted probability of the event for all individuals in the data set? There’s no way I’m doing that calculation for every person in the data set. Using the main effects model from above, stored in the object mvmodel, we can call the predict() command to generate a vector of predictions for each row used in the model. Any row with missing data on any variable used in the model will NOT get a predicted value. The mvmodel object contains a lot of information. I recommend you look at str(mvmodel) on your own time as it’s too much to print out here. The important pieces for this section is that the data used in the model (all complete case records) are stored. mvmodel &lt;- glm(cases ~ age + income + sex, data=depress, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) model.pred.prob &lt;- predict(mvmodel, type=&#39;response&#39;) Calling dim(model.pred.prob) gives us 294. This matches the number of complete case records used to build the model. This is the same length as mvmodel$y, so we can bind them together in a data frame (useful for plotting). The model.pred.prob is a vector of individual predicted probabilities of the outcome (being depressed). To classify individual \\(i\\) as being depressed or not, we draw a binary value (\\(x_{i} = 0 or 1\\)), with probability \\(p_{i}\\) by using the rbinom function, with a size=1. set.seed(12345) #reminder: change the combo on my luggage plot.mpp &lt;- data.frame(pred.prob = model.pred.prob, pred.class = rbinom(n=length(model.pred.prob), size=1, p=model.pred.prob), truth = mvmodel$y) head(plot.mpp) ## pred.prob pred.class truth ## 1 0.21108906 0 0 ## 2 0.08014012 0 0 ## 3 0.15266203 0 0 ## 4 0.24527840 1 0 ## 5 0.15208679 0 0 ## 6 0.17056409 0 0 Applying class labels and creating a cross table of predicted vs truth: plot.mpp &lt;- plot.mpp %&gt;% mutate(pred.class = factor(pred.class, labels=c(&quot;Not Depressed&quot;, &quot;Depressed&quot;)), truth = factor(truth, labels=c(&quot;Not Depressed&quot;, &quot;Depressed&quot;))) table(plot.mpp$pred.class, plot.mpp$truth) ## ## Not Depressed Depressed ## Not Depressed 195 35 ## Depressed 49 15 The model correctly identified 195 individuals as not depressed and 15 as depressed. The model got it wrong 49 + 25 times. Is this good? What if death were the event? 10.1.0.1 Distribution of Predictions Another important feature to look at is to see how well the model discriminates between the two groups in terms of predicted probabilities. Let’s look at a plot: ggplot(plot.mpp, aes(x=truth, y=pred.prob, fill=truth)) + geom_jitter(width=.2) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + theme_bw() What do you notice in this plot? What can you infer? "],
["confusion-matrix.html", "10.2 Confusion Matrix", " 10.2 Confusion Matrix A confusion Matrix is the 2x2 table that compares the predicted classes to the true classes. table(plot.mpp$pred.class, plot.mpp$truth) ## ## Not Depressed Depressed ## Not Depressed 195 35 ## Depressed 49 15 This table was generated by drawing a random Bernoulli variable with probability \\(p_{i}\\). This assumes that probabilities can range from [0,1], but if you look at the plots above, the predicted probabilities max out around 0.5. Often we adjust the cutoff value to improve accuracy. This is where we have to put our gut feeling of what probability constitutes “high risk”. For some models, this could be as low as 30%. It’s whatever the probability is that optimally separates the classes. This is an important tuning parameter because since the models we build are only based on data we measured, often there are other unmeasured confounding factors that affect the predicted probability. So our predictions don’t span the full range from [0,1]. Using the above plots, where should we put the cutoff value? At what probability should we classify a record as “depressed”? There are many different types of criteria that can be used to find the optimal cutoff value. But first we need to understand the expanded borders of a [Confusion Matrix]. Confusion matrix. Credit: Wikipedia Using the confusionMatrix function inside the caret package performs all these calculations for us. You must specify what the ‘event’ is. This is also another place where the factor ordering of binary variables can cause headache.

We can use this probability to classify each row into groups. The assigned class values must match the data type and levels of the true value.
