One of the most misunderstood parts of the analysis process is the data preparation stage. To say that 70% of any analysis is spent on the data management stage is not an understatement.

["generating-a-reproducible-workflows.html", "1.1 Generating a reproducible workflows", " 1.1 Generating a reproducible workflows Reproducibility is the ability for any researcher to take the same data set and run the same set of software program instructions as another researcher and achieve the same results. The goal is to create an exact record of what was done to a data set to produce a specific result. To achieve reproducibility, we believe that three things must be present: The un-processed data are connected directly to software code file(s) that perform data preparation techniques. The processed data are connected directly to other software code file(s) that perform the analyses. All data and code files are self-contained such that they could be given to another researcher to execute the code commands on a separate computer and achieve the same results as the original author. PrepareData Why do we need a codebook? You are your own collaborator 6 months from now. Make sure you will be able to understand what you were doing. Investing the time to do things clearly and in a reproducible manner will make your future self happy. Comment your code with explanations and instructions. How did you get from point A to B? Why did you recode this variable in this manner? We need to record those steps (not just for posterity). This means your code must be saved in a script file. Include sufficient notes to yourself describing what you are doing and why. For R, this can be in a .R or .RMD file. I always prefer the latter. For SPSS you can specify to paste the syntax and copy into a .sps script file. For SAS you’ll use a .sas file For STATA this will be a .do file Repro Figure Credits: Roger Peng 1.1.1 Literate programming Programming paradigm introduced by Knuth (1984) Explain the logic of the program or analysis process in a natural language, Small code snippets included at each step act as a full set of instructions that can be executed to reproduce the result/analysis being discussed. Literate programming tools are integrated into most common statistical packages Markdown (R, Stata) \\(\\LaTeX\\) (R, SAS, Stata) 1.1.2 Reproducible Research + Literate Programming Practicing reproducible research techniques using literate programming tools allows such major updates to be a simple matter of re-compiling all coded instructions using the updated data set. The effort then is reduced to a careful review and update of any written results. Using literate programming tools create formatted documents section headers bold and italicized words tables and graphics with built-in captions in a streamlined manner that is fully synchronized with the code itself. The author writes the text explanations, interpretations, and code in the statistical software program itself, and the program will execute all commands and combine the text, code and output all together into a final dynamic document. What stages of the pipeline shown above can we conduct using literate programming tools? "],

["data-management.html", "1.3 Data Management", " 1.3 Data Management Questions to ask yourself (and the data) while reviewing the codebook to choose variables to be used in an analysis. Do you need to code out missing data? Missing values sometimes are recorded as something like MISSING or -99? Do you need to make response codes more logical? Some systems will record 1=YES and 2=NO. This should be changed to 0=NO. Do you need to recode numerical variables to categorical? Sometimes categorical data will be recorded as 1, 2, 3 etc when those numbers represent named categories. Do you need to create secondary variables? Such as an average across measures to create a score. Some of these answers will come only after you look at your data. This can be looking at the raw data itself but also looking at tables and charts generated from the data. Often when you try to create a plot or table you will encounter an error or something odd looking that will be the notification that something has to be adjusted. Let’s look at a few of the common data management processes. 1.3.1 Missing data In Excel, missing data can show up as a blank cell. In SPSS it is represented as a . period. R displays missing data as NA values. Missing Data in SPSS: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/modules/missing-data/ Why would data be missing? Other than the obvious data entry errors, tech glitches or just non-cooperative plants or people, sometimes values are out of range and you would rather delete them than change their value (data edit). Lets look at the religion variable in the depression data set. table(depress$relig, useNA=&quot;always&quot;) ## ## 1 2 3 4 6 &lt;NA&gt; ## 155 51 30 56 2 0 Looking at the codebook, there is no category 6 for religion. Let’s change all values to NA. depress$relig[depress$relig==6] &lt;- NA This code says take all rows where relig is equal to 6, and change them to NA. Confirm recode. table(depress$relig, useNA=&quot;always&quot;) ## ## 1 2 3 4 &lt;NA&gt; ## 155 51 30 56 2 Notice the use of the useNA=\"always\" argument. If we just looked at the base table without this argument, we would have never known there was missing data! table(depress$relig) ## ## 1 2 3 4 ## 155 51 30 56 What about continuous variables? Well there happens to be no other missing data in this data set, so let’s make up a set of 7 data points stored in a variable named y. y &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 4, NA, 6) y ## [1] 1 2 3 NA 4 NA 6 The #1 way to identify missing data in a continuous variable is by looking at the summary() values. mean(y) ## [1] NA summary(y) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s ## 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.2 4.0 6.0 2 mean(y, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 3.2 In R, any arithmetic function (like addition, multiplication) on missing data results in a missing value. The na.rm=TRUE toggle tells R to calculate the complete case mean. This is a biased measure of the mean, but missing data is a topic worthy of it’s own course. 1.3.2 Identifying Variable Types The str function is short for structure. This shows you the variable names, what data types R thinks each variable are, and some of the raw data. You can also use the view() function to open the data as a similar spreadsheet format, or head() to see the top 6 rows of the data. The latter is sometimes less than helpful for a very large data set. str(depress) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 294 obs. of 37 variables: ## $ id : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ sex : int 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 ... ## $ age : int 68 58 45 50 33 24 58 22 47 30 ... ## $ marital : int 5 3 2 3 4 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ educat : int 2 4 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 2 ... ## $ employ : int 4 1 1 3 1 1 5 1 4 1 ... ## $ income : int 4 15 28 9 35 11 11 9 23 35 ... ## $ relig : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 ... ## $ c1 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 ... ## $ c2 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ... ## $ c3 : int 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 ... ## $ c4 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 ... ## $ c5 : int 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 ... ## $ c6 : int 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 3 0 ... ## $ c7 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ c8 : int 0 0 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 0 ... ## $ c9 : int 0 0 0 0 3 1 2 0 0 0 ... ## $ c10 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ c11 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ c12 : int 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 0 ... ## $ c13 : int 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ c14 : int 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... ## $ c15 : int 0 1 1 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 ... ## $ c16 : int 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 3 0 ... ## $ c17 : int 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ... ## $ c18 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... ## $ c19 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... ## $ c20 : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... ## $ cesd : int 0 4 4 5 6 7 15 10 16 0 ... ## $ cases : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ... ## $ drink : int 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 ... ## $ health : int 2 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 4 1 ... ## $ regdoc : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 ... ## $ treat : int 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 ... ## $ beddays : int 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ... ## $ acuteill: int 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 ... ## $ chronill: int 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 ... Right away this tells me that R thinks all variables are numeric integers, not categorical variables. This will have to be changed. We’ll get to that in a moment. In SPSS you’ll the following set of icons to tell you what data types the program thinks each column is: Consider the variable that measures marital status. table(depress$marital) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 ## 73 127 43 13 38 str(depress$marital) ## int [1:294] 5 3 2 3 4 2 2 1 2 2 ... class(depress$marital) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; What data type does R see this variable as? When variables have numerical levels it is necessary to ensure that the program knows it is a factor variable. The following code uses the factor() function to take the marital status variable and convert it into a factor variable with specified labels that match the codebook. depress$marital &lt;- factor(depress$marital, labels = c(&quot;Never Married&quot;, &quot;Married&quot;, &quot;Divorced&quot;, &quot;Separated&quot;, &quot;Widowed&quot;)) It is important to confirm the recode worked. If it did not you will have to re-read in the raw data set again since the variable marital was replaced. table(depress$marital) ## ## Never Married Married Divorced Separated Widowed ## 73 127 43 13 38 class(depress$marital) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; 1.3.3 Outliers Let’s look at the age variable in the depression data set. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) boxplot(depress$age) hist(depress$age) Just looking at the data graphically raises no red flags. The boxplot shows no outlying values and the histogram does not look wildly skewed. This is where knowledge about the data set is essential. The codebook does not provide a valid range for the data, but the description of the data starting on page 3 in the textbook clarifies that this data set is on adults. In the research world, this specifies 18 years or older. Now look back at the graphics. See anything odd? It appears as if the data go pretty far below 20, possibly below 18. Let’s check the numerical summary to get more details. summary(depress$age) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 9.00 28.00 42.50 44.38 59.00 89.00 The minimum value is a 9, which is outside the range of valid values for this variable. This is where you, as a statistician, data analyst or researcher goes back to the PI and asks for advice. Should this data be set to missing, or edited in a way that changes this data point into a valid piece of data. Another visual way to look for outliers in a continuous measurement is to create a boxplot. Here we look at boxplots of income across marital status category. ggplot(depress, aes(y=income, x=marital)) + geom_boxplot() While there are a few potential outliers (denoted by the dots), there are none so far away from the rest of the group (or at values such as 99 or -99 that may indicate missing codes) that we need to be concerned about. As an example of a common data entry error, and for demonstration purposes, I went in and changed a 19 to a 9. So the correct thing to do here is to change that 9, back to a 19. This is a very good use of the ifelse() function. depress$age &lt;- ifelse(depress$age==9, 19, depress$age) The logical statement is depress$age9. Wherever this is true, replace the value of depress$age with 19, wherever this is false then keep the value of depress$age unchanged (by “replacing” the new value with the same old value). Alternatively, you can change that one value using bracket notation. Here you are specifying that you only want the rows where age==9, and directly assign a value of 19 to those rows. depress$age[depress$age==9] &lt;- 19 Confirm the recode. summary(depress$age) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 18.00 28.00 42.50 44.41 59.00 89.00 Looks like it worked. 1.3.4 Creating secondary variables 1.3.4.1 Collapsing categorical variables into fewer categories For unbiased and accurate results of a statistical analysis, sufficient data has to be present. Often times once you start slicing and dicing the data to only look at certain groups, or if you are interested in the behavior of certain variables across levels of another variable, sometimes you start to run into small sample size problems. For example, consider marital status again. There are only 13 people who report being separated. This could potentially be too small of a group size for valid statistical analysis. One way to deal with insufficient data within a certain category is to collapse categories. The following code uses the recode() function from the car package to create a new variable that I am calling marital2 that combines the Divorced and Separated levels. library(car) marital2 &lt;- recode(depress$marital, &quot;&#39;Divorced&#39; = &#39;Sep/Div&#39;; &#39;Separated&#39; = &#39;Sep/Div&#39;&quot;) Always confirm your recodes. table(depress$marital, marital2, useNA=&quot;always&quot;) ## marital2 ## Married Never Married Sep/Div Widowed &lt;NA&gt; ## Never Married 0 73 0 0 0 ## Married 127 0 0 0 0 ## Divorced 0 0 43 0 0 ## Separated 0 0 13 0 0 ## Widowed 0 0 0 38 0 ## &lt;NA&gt; 0 0 0 0 0 This confirms that records where marital (rows) is Divorced or Separated have the value of Sep/Div for marital2 (columns). And that no missing data crept up in the process. Now I can drop the temporary marital2 variable and actually fix marital. (keeping it clean) depress$marital &lt;- recode(depress$marital, &quot;&#39;Divorced&#39; = &#39;Sep/Div&#39;; &#39;Separated&#39; = &#39;Sep/Div&#39;&quot;) rm(marital2) 1.3.4.2 Binning a continuous variable into categorical ranges. Let’s create a new variable that categorizes income into the following ranges: &lt;30, [30, 40), [40,50), [50, 60), 60+. The easiest way is to use the cut2 function in the package Hmisc. Note you don’t have to load the package fully to use a function from within that package. Useful for times when you only need to use a function once or twice. depress$inc_cut &lt;- Hmisc::cut2(depress$income, cuts=c(30,40,50,60)) table(depress$inc_cut) ## ## [ 2,30) [30,40) [40,50) [50,60) [60,65] ## 231 28 16 9 10 1.3.4.3 Dichotomizing a measure into 2 categories Dichotomous variables tend to be binary indicator variables where a code of 1 is the level you’re interested in. For example, gender is coded as 2=Female and 1=Male. This is in the right direction but it needs to be 0/1. depress$sex &lt;- depress$sex -1 table(depress$sex) ## ## 0 1 ## 111 183 0/1 binary coding is mandatory for many analyses. One simple reason is that now you can calculate the mean and interpret it as a proportion. mean(depress$sex) ## [1] 0.622449 62% of individuals in this data set are female. Sometimes the data is recorded as 1/2 (Yes/No), so just subtracting from 1 doesn’t create a positive indicator of the variable. For example, drink=1 if they are a regular drinker, and drink=2 if they are not. We want not drinking to be coded as 0, not 2. table(depress$drink) ## ## 1 2 ## 234 60 The ifelse() function says that if depress$DRINK has a value equal to 2 ==2, then change the value to 0. Otherwise leave it alone. depress$drink &lt;- ifelse(depress$drink==2, 0, depress$drink) table(depress$drink) ## ## 0 1 ## 60 234 1.3.4.4 Sum or Average values across multiple variables The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) is series of questions asked to a person to measure their level of depression. CESD is calculated as the sum of all 20 component variables, and is already on this data set. Let’s create a new variable named sleep as subscale for sleep quality by adding up question numbers 5, 11, and 19. Reference: http://cesd-r.com/cesdr/ depress$sleep &lt;- depress$c5 + depress$c11 + depress$c19 ## # depress &lt;- depress %&gt;% mutate(sleep = c5+c11+c19) # Not run. dplyr example summary(depress$sleep) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.000 0.000 1.000 1.167 2.000 7.000 1.3.4.5 Transformations for Normality Let’s look at assessing normal distributions using the cleaned depression data set. rm(depress) # remove the current version that was used in the previous part of this markdown file depress &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/depress_081217.txt&quot;, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, header=TRUE) hist(depress$income, prob=TRUE, xlab=&quot;Annual income (in thousands)&quot;, main=&quot;Histogram and Density curve of Income&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;) lines(density(depress$income), col=&quot;blue&quot;) summary(depress$income) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 2.00 9.00 15.00 20.57 28.00 65.00 The distribution of annual income is slightly skewed right with a mean of $20.5k per year and a median of $15k per year income. The range of values goes from $2k to $65k. Reported income above $40k appear to have been rounded to the nearest $10k, because there are noticeable peaks at $40k, $50k, and $60k. In general, transformations are more effective when the the standard deviation is large relative to the mean. One rule of thumb is if the sd/mean ratio is less than 1/4, a transformation may not be necessary. sd(depress$income) / mean(depress$income) ## [1] 0.743147 Alternatively Hoaglin, Mosteller and Tukey (1985) showed that if the largest observation divided by the smallest observation is over 2, then the data may not be sufficiently variable for the transformation to be decisive. max(depress$income) / (min(depress$income)+.1) ## [1] 30.95238 Note these rules are not meaningful for data without a natural zero. Another common method of assessing normality is to create a normal probability (or normal quantile) plot. qqnorm(depress$income);qqline(depress$income, col=&quot;red&quot;) The points on the normal probability plot do not follow the red reference line very well. The dots show a more curved, or U shaped form rather than following a linear line. This is another indication that the data is skewed and a transformation for normality should be created. Create three new variables: log10inc as the log base 10 of Income, loginc as the natural log of Income, and xincome which is equal to the negative of one divided by the cubic root of income. log10inc &lt;- log10(depress$income) loginc &lt;- log(depress$income) xincome &lt;- -1/(depress$income)^(-1/3) Create a single plot that display normal probability plots for the original, and each of the three transformations of income. Use the base graphics grid organizer par(mfrow=c(r,c)) where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. Which transformation does a better job of normalizing the distribution of Income? par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Try (4,1) and (1,4) to see how this works. qqnorm(depress$income, main=&quot;Income&quot;); qqline(depress$income,col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(log10inc, main=&quot;Log 10&quot;); qqline(log10inc, col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(loginc, main = &quot;Natural Log&quot;); qqline(loginc, col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(xincome, main=&quot;-1/cuberoot(income)&quot;); qqline(xincome, col=&quot;blue&quot;) "],

Alternatively you can look into methods to conduct factor analysis with missing data (FactomineR) If no ID column exists, create one: id = 1:NROW(data) Use select() to extract ID and all variables used in the factor analysis Do na.omit() Conduct factor analysis on this subsetted data set Use bind_cols() to add columns containing factor scores to this subsetted data set as described above Use select() to only keep the ID and the factor score variables Then left_join() the factor scores back to the original data, using the ID variable as the joining key.

["data-viz.html", "Chapter 2 Visualizing Data", " Chapter 2 Visualizing Data Visualizing your data is hands down the most important thing you can learn to do. There are links to additional resources at the end of this document for additional learning. There are two audiences in mind when creating data visualizations: For your eyes only (FYEO). These are quick and dirty plots, without annotation. Meant to be looked at once or twice. To share with others. These need to completely stand on their own. Axes labels, titles, colors as needed, possibly captions. You will see, and slowly learn, how to add these annotations and how to clean up your graphics to make them sharable. ggplot2 already does a lot of this work for you. We will also use the two most common methods used to create plots. 1) Base graphics, 2) the ggplot2 package. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you have not done so already, go ahead and install the ggplot2 package now. For almost every plot discussed we will create two types of plots FYEO - using base graphics. (Base == Comes with R) Very powerful, but can be technical. FYEO - using ggplot2. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. As time permits I will update each section with a third type of plot - Sharable - Contains all bells and whistles needed to make it presentable to others. Your task, should you choose to accept, is to follow along through this tutorial and at each step try to reproduce the plot shown. You can accomplish this by simply copying and pasting the syntax into a new R code (or R Markdown) document. "],
["the-syntax-of-ggplot.html", "2.1 The syntax of ggplot", " 2.1 The syntax of ggplot The reason we use the functions in ggplot2 is for consistency in the structure of it’s arguments. Here is a bare bones generic plotting function: ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, col=col, fill=fill, group=group)) + geom_THING() 2.1.1 Required arguments data: What data set is this plot using? This is ALWAYS the first argument. aes(): This is the aestetics of the plot. What’s variable is on the x, what is on the y? Do you want to color by another variable, perhaps fill some box by the value of another variable, or group by a variable. geom_THING(): Every plot has to have a geometry. What is the shape of the thing you want to plot? Do you want to plot points - use geom_points(). Want to connect those points with a line? Use geom_lines(). We will see many varieties in this lab. 2.1.2 Optional but helpful arguments ggtitle: This is the overall plot title xlab() and ylab() axis titles. scale_xy_blah to extend limits scale_fill_blah to specifying a fixed color, and change auto legend title themes For a full , and comprehensive tutorial and reference guide on how to do nearly anything in ggplot – this is by far my favorite reference http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/ I reference things in there (like how to remove or change the title of a legend) constantly.

["univariate-visualizations.html", "2.3 Univariate Visualizations", " 2.3 Univariate Visualizations 2.3.1 Categorical variables Both Nominal and Ordinal data types can be visualized using the same methods: tables, barcharts and pie charts. 2.3.1.1 Tables Tables are the most common way to get summary statistics of a categorical variable. The table() function produces a frequency table, where each entry represents the number of records in the data set holding the corresponding labeled value. table(dsmall$cut) ## ## Fair Good Very Good Premium Ideal ## 34 99 220 257 390 There are 27 Fair quality diamonds, 83 good quality and 387 Ideal quality diamonds in this sample. 2.3.1.2 Barcharts / Barplots A Barchart or barplot takes these frequencies, and draws bars along the X-axis where the height of the bars is determined by the frequencies seen in the table. base To create a barplot/barchart in base graphics requires the data to be in summarized in a table form first. Then the result of the table is plotted. The first argument is the table to be plotted, the main argument controls the title. dc &lt;- table(dsmall$cut) barplot(dc, main=&quot;Barchart using base graphics&quot;) ggplot The geometry needed to draw a barchart in ggplot is geom_bar(). ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut)) + geom_bar() pretty The biggest addition to a barchart is the numbers on top of the bars. This isn’t mandatory, but it does make it nice. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut)) + theme_bw() + geom_bar(aes(y = ..count..)) + ggtitle(&quot;Frequnency of diamonds by cut type&quot;) + geom_text(aes(y=..count.. + 10, label=..count..), stat=&#39;count&#39;, size = 5) 2.3.1.3 Plotting Proportions Often you don’t want to compare counts but percents. To accomplish this, we have to aggregate the data to calculate the proportions first, then plot the aggregated data using geom_col to create the columns. cut.props &lt;- data.frame(prop.table(table(dsmall$cut))) cut.props # what does this data look like? ## Var1 Freq ## 1 Fair 0.034 ## 2 Good 0.099 ## 3 Very Good 0.220 ## 4 Premium 0.257 ## 5 Ideal 0.390 ggplot(cut.props, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_col() + ylab(&quot;Proportion&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Cut type&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Proportion of diamonds by cut type&quot;) 2.3.1.4 Cleveland Dot Plots Another way to visualize categorical data that takes up less ink than bars is a Cleveland dot plot. Here again we are plotting summary data instead of the raw data. This uses the geom_segment that draws the lines from x=0 to the value of the proportion (named Freq because of the way data.frame works). ggplot(cut.props, aes(x=Freq, y=Var1)) + geom_point(size = 3) + xlab(&quot;Proportion of diamonds&quot;) + theme_bw() + ylab(&quot;Cut Type&quot;) + geom_segment(aes(x=0, xend=Freq, y=Var1, yend=Var1), color=&#39;grey50&#39;) 2.3.1.5 Pie Chart Just like barplot(), pie() takes a table object as it’s argument. base dc &lt;- table(dsmall$cut) pie(dc) Pie charts are my least favorite plotting type. Human eyeballs can’t distinguish between angles as well as we can with heights. A mandatory piece needed to make the wedges readable is to add the percentages of each wedge. pie(dc, labels = paste0(names(dc), &#39; (&#39;, prop.table(dc)*100, &quot;%)&quot;)) ggplot And here I thought pie charts couldn’t get worse… i’m not a fan at all of the ggplot version. So i’m not even going to show it. Here’s a link to another great tutorial that does show you how to make one. http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-pie-chart-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization However – Never say never. Here’s an example of a good use of pie charts. http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2019/8/8/forty-five-pie-charts-never-say-never 2.3.1.6 Waffle Chart This type of chart is not natively found in the ggplot2 package, but it’s own waffle package. These are great for infographics. Reference: https://www.r-bloggers.com/making-waffle-charts-in-r-with-the-new-waffle-package/ library(waffle) waffle(dc/10, rows=5, size=0.5, title=&quot;Cut quality of diamond&quot;, xlab=&quot;1 square == 10 diamonds&quot;) 2.3.2 Continuous Measures Here we can look at the price, carat, and depth of the diamonds. 2.3.2.1 Dotplot plot(dsmall$depth) The base function plot() creates a dotplot for a continuous variable. The value of the variable is plotted on the y axis, and the index, or row number, is plotted on the x axis. This gives you a nice, quick way to see the values of the data. Often you are not interested in the individual values of each data point, but the distribution of the data. In other words, where is the majority of the data? Does it look symmetric around some central point? Around what values do the bulk of the data lie? 2.3.2.2 Histograms Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a . The height of the bars in a histogram display the frequency of values that fall into those of those bins. For example if we cut the poverty rates into 7 bins of equal width, the frequency table would look like this: table(cut(dsmall$depth, 7)) ## ## (55.3,57.6] (57.6,59.8] (59.8,62.1] (62.1,64.4] (64.4,66.7] (66.7,68.9] ## 6 79 536 351 23 3 ## (68.9,71.2] ## 2 In a histogram, the binned counts are plotted as bars into a histogram. Note that the x-axis is continuous, so the bars touch. This is unlike the barchart that has a categorical x-axis, and vertical bars that are separated. base You can make a histogram in base graphics super easy. hist(dsmall$depth) And it doesn’t take too much to clean it up. Here you can specify the number of bins by specifying how many breaks should be made in the data (the number of breaks controls the number of bins, and bin width) and use col for the fill color. hist(dsmall$depth, xlab=&quot;depth&quot;, main=&quot;Histogram of diamond depth&quot;, col=&quot;cyan&quot;, breaks=20) ggplot ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.2) The binwidth here is set by looking at the cut points above that were used to create 7 bins. Notice that darkgrey is the default fill color, but makes it hard to differentiate between the bars. So we’ll make the outline black using colour, and fill the bars with white. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_histogram(colour=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;white&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Distribution of diamond depth&quot;) Note I did not specify the binwidth argument here. The size of the bins can hide features from your graph, the default value for ggplot2 is range/30 and usually is a good choice. 2.3.2.3 Density plots To get a better idea of the true shape of the distribution we can “smooth” out the bins and create what’s called a density plot or curve. Notice that the shape of this distribution curve is much more… “wigglier” than the histogram may have implied. base plot(density(dsmall$depth)) Awesome title huh? (NOT) ggplot2 ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_density() 2.3.2.4 Histograms + density Often is is more helpful to have the density (or kernel density) plot on top of a histogram plot. Base Since the height of the bars in a histogram default to showing the frequency of records in the data set within that bin, we need to 1) scale the height so that it’s a relative frequency, and then use the lines() function to add a density() line on top. hist(dsmall$depth, prob=TRUE) lines(density(dsmall$depth), col=&quot;blue&quot;) ggplot The syntax starts the same, we’ll add a new geom, geom_density and color the line blue. Then we add the histogram geom using geom_histogram but must specify that the y axis should be on the density, not frequency, scale. Note that this has to go inside the aesthetic statement aes(). I’m also going to get rid of the fill by using NA so it doesn’t plot over the density line. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth)) + geom_density(col=&quot;blue&quot;) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour=&quot;black&quot;, fill=NA) 2.3.2.5 Boxplots Another very common way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is using a boxplot. Boxplots are useful for quickly identifying where the bulk of your data lie. R specifically draws a “modified” boxplot where values that are considered outliers are plotted as dots. base boxplot(dsmall$depth) Notice that the only axis labeled is the y=axis. Like a dotplot the x axis, or “width”, of the boxplot is meaningless here. We can make the axis more readable by flipping the plot on it’s side. boxplot(dsmall$depth, horizontal = TRUE, main=&quot;Distribution of diamond prices&quot;, xlab=&quot;Dollars&quot;) Horizontal is a bit easier to read in my opinion. ggplot What about ggplot? ggplot doesn’t really like to do univariate boxplots. We can get around that by specifying that we want the box placed at a specific x value. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_boxplot() To flip it horizontal you may think to simply swap x and y? Good thinking. Of course it wouldn’t be that easy. So let’s just flip the whole darned plot on it’s coordinate axis. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() 2.3.2.6 Violin plots ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_violin() 2.3.2.7 Boxplot + Violin plots Overlaying a boxplot and a violin plot serves a similar purpose to Histograms + Density plots. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + geom_violin() + geom_boxplot() Better appearance - different levels of transparency of the box and violin. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=1, y=depth)) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + theme_bw() + geom_violin(fill=&quot;blue&quot;, alpha=.1) + geom_boxplot(fill=&quot;blue&quot;, alpha=.5, width=.2) + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) 2.3.2.8 Normal QQ plots The last useful plot that we will do on a single continuous variable is to assess the normality of the distribution. Basically how close the data follows a normal distribution. base qqnorm(dsmall$price) qqline(dsmall$price, col=&quot;red&quot;) The line I make red because it is a reference line. The closer the points are to following this line, the more “normal” the shape of the distribution is. Price has some pretty strong deviation away from that line. Below I have plotted what a normal distribution looks like as an example of a “perfect” fit. z &lt;- rnorm(1000) qqnorm(z) qqline(z, col=&quot;blue&quot;) ggplot qq (or qnorm) plots specifically plot the data against a theoretical distribution. That means in the aes() aesthetic argument we don’t specify either x or y, but instead the sample= is the variable we want to plot. ggplot(dsmall, aes(sample=price)) + stat_qq() Additional references on making qqplots in ggplot: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-qq-plot-quantile-quantile-graph-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization "],

A side by side barchart is preferable. The beside=TRUE is what controls the placement of the bars. barplot(cc, main=&quot;quick side by side barchart using base graphics&quot;, beside=TRUE) ggplot Again plot the cut on the x axis, but then fill using the second categorical variable. This has the effect of visualizing the row percents from the table above. The percent of color, within each type of cut. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut, fill=color)) + geom_bar() Again the default is a stacked barchart. So we just specify position=dodge to put the bars side by side. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut, fill=color)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) And look, an automatic legend. What if I wanted to better compare cut within color group? This is the column percentages. Just switch which variable is the x axis and which one is used to fill the colors! ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=color, fill=cut)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) For more than 2 colors I do not recommend choosing the colors yourself. I know little about color theory so I use the built-in color palettes. Here is a great cheatsheet about using color palettes. And this easy change is why we love ggplot2. 2.4.2 Grouped bar charts with percentages Not as easy as one would hope, but the solution is to calculate the desired percentages first and then plot the summary data using either geom_bar(stat='identity') or geom_col(). calc.props &lt;- diamonds %&gt;% group_by(color, cut) %&gt;% summarise(count=n()) %&gt;% mutate(pct=round(count/sum(count),3)) calc.props ## # A tibble: 35 x 4 ## # Groups: color [7] ## color cut count pct ## &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 D Fair 163 0.024 ## 2 D Good 662 0.098 ## 3 D Very Good 1513 0.223 ## 4 D Premium 1603 0.237 ## 5 D Ideal 2834 0.418 ## 6 E Fair 224 0.023 ## 7 E Good 933 0.095 ## 8 E Very Good 2400 0.245 ## 9 E Premium 2337 0.239 ## 10 E Ideal 3903 0.398 ## # ... with 25 more rows Since we’re plotting summary data, the height of the bars is specified using y=pct. ggplot(calc.props, aes(x=color, fill=cut, y=pct)) + geom_col(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_bw() Now set some options to the y axis using scale_y_continuous() to make the graph more accurate and readable. The labels=percent comes from the scales package. library(scales) ggplot(calc.props, aes(x=color, fill=cut, y=pct)) + geom_col(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1), labels=percent) 2.4.2.1 sjPlot sjPlot does a very nice job of being able to cleanly show not only n’s but percents. library(sjPlot) sjp.xtab(dsmall$color, dsmall$cut, margin=&quot;row&quot;, coord.flip = TRUE) 2.4.2.2 Mosaic plots But what if you want to know how two categorical variables are related and you don’t want to look at two different barplots? Mosaic plots are a way to visualize the proportions in a table. So here’s the two-way table we’ll be plotting. table(dsmall$cut, dsmall$color) ## ## D E F G H I J ## Fair 5 6 7 4 5 4 3 ## Good 18 23 11 16 17 7 7 ## Very Good 26 37 46 40 33 25 13 ## Premium 34 53 43 49 41 24 13 ## Ideal 54 63 79 92 53 34 15 The syntax for a mosaic plot uses model notation, which is basically y ~ x where the ~ is read as “twiddle” or “tilde”. It’s to the left of your 1 key. mosaicplot(cut~color, data=dsmall) Helpful, ish. Here are two very useful options. In reverse obviousness, color applies shades of gray to one of the factor levels, and shade applies a color gradient scale to the cells in order of what is less than expected (red) to what is more than expected (blue) if these two factors were completely independent. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # display the plots in 1 row and 2 columns mosaicplot(cut~color, data=dsmall, color=TRUE) mosaicplot(cut~color, data=dsmall, shade=TRUE) For example, there are fewer ‘Very Good’ cut diamonds that are color ‘G’, and fewer ‘Premium’ cut diamonds that are color ‘H’. As you can see, knowing what your data means when trying to interpret what the plots are telling you is essential. That’s about all the ways you can plot categorical variables. If you are wondering why there was no 3D barcharts demonstrated see here, here, and here for other ways you can really screw up your visualization. 2.4.3 Continuous v. Continuous 2.4.3.1 Scatterplot The most common method of visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables is by using a scatterplot. base Back to the plot() command. Here we use model notation again, so it’s \\(y~x\\). plot(price~carat, data=dsmall) Looks like for the most part as the carat value increases so does price. That makes sense. ggplot With ggplot we specify both the x and y variables, and add a point. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() Other Resources http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/scatterplot.html https://www.r-bloggers.com/scatterplot-matrices/ 2.4.3.2 Adding lines to the scatterplots Two most common trend lines added to a scatterplots are the “best fit” straight line and the “lowess” smoother line. base The best fit line (in blue) gets added by using the abline() function wrapped around the linear model function lm(). Note it uses the same model notation syntax and the data= statement as the plot() function does. The lowess line is added using the lines() function, but the lowess() function itself doesn’t allow for the data= statement so we have to use $ sign notation. plot(price~carat, data=dsmall) abline(lm(price~carat, data=dsmall), col=&quot;blue&quot;) lines(lowess(dsmall$price~dsmall$carat), col=&quot;red&quot;) ggplot With ggplot, we just add a geom_smooth() layer. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() Here the point-wise confidence interval for this lowess line is shown in grey. If you want to turn the confidence interval off, use se=FALSE. Also notice that the smoothing geom uses a different function or window than the lowess function used in base graphics. Here it is again using the ggplot plotting function and adding another geom_smooth() layer for the lm (linear model) line in blue, and the lowess line (by not specifying a method) in red. ggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method=&quot;lm&quot;, color=&quot;blue&quot;) + geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color=&quot;red&quot;) 2.4.3.3 Line plots Line plots connect each dot with a straight line. This is most often done when measuring trends of the response as the value of x increases (such as a time series) We saw earlier that carat and price seemed possibly linear. Let see how the average price changes with carat. library(dplyr) price.per.carat &lt;- dsmall %&gt;% group_by(carat) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(price)) base For base graphics, type=‘b’ means both points and lines, ‘l’ gives you just lines and ‘p’ gives you only points. You can find more plotting character options under ?pch. plot(mean~carat, data=price.per.carat, type=&#39;l&#39;) ggplot With ggplot we specify that we want a line geometry only. ggplot(price.per.carat, aes(x=carat, y=mean)) + geom_line() How does this relationship change with cut of the diamond? First lets get the average price per combination of carat and cut. ppc2 &lt;- dsmall %&gt;% group_by(cut, carat) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(price)) base This plot can be created in base graphics, but it takes an advanced knowledge of the graphics system to do so. So I do not show it here. ggplot This is where ggplot starts to excel in it’s ease of creating more complex plots. All we have to do is specify that we want the lines colored by the cut variable. ggplot(ppc2, aes(x=carat, y=mean, col=cut)) + geom_line() And we get one line per cut. 2.4.4 Continuous v. Categorical Create an appropriate plot for a continuous variable, and plot it for each level of the categorical variable. 2.4.4.1 Dotplot/strip chart Dotplots can be very useful when plotting dots against several categories. They can also be called stripcharts. base stripchart(carat ~ cut, data=dsmall) Doesn’t look to pretty, but kinda gets the point across.

["bv-ttest.html", "5.3 (Q~B) Two means: T-Test", " 5.3 (Q~B) Two means: T-Test It is common to compare means from different samples. For instance, we might investigate the effectiveness of a certain educational intervention by looking for evidence of greater reading ability in the treatment group against a control group. That is, our research hypothesis is that reading ability of a child is associated with an educational intervention. The null hypothesis states that there is no relationship, or no effect, of the educational intervention (binary explanatory variable) on the reading ability of the child (quantitative response variable). This can be written in symbols as follows: \\[H_{0}: \\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2}\\mbox{ or }\\qquad H_{0}: \\mu_{1} -\\mu_{2}=0\\] where \\(\\mu_{1}\\) is the average reading score for students in the control group (no intervention) and \\(\\mu_{2}\\) be the average reading score for students in the intervention group. Notice it can be written as one mean equals the other, but also as the difference between two means equaling zero. The alternative hypothesis \\(H_{A}\\) states that there is a relationship: \\[H_{A}: \\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{2} \\qquad \\mbox{ or } \\qquad H_{A}: \\mu_{1}-\\mu_{2} \\neq 0\\] 5.3.1 Assumptions The data distribution for each group is approximately normal. The scores are independent within each group. The scores from the two groups are independent of each other (i.e. the two samples are independent). 5.3.2 Sampling Distribution for the difference We use \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) as a point estimate for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), which has a standard error of \\[ SE_{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2} = \\sqrt{SE_{\\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\\bar{x}_2}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_2}} \\] So the equations for a Confidence Interval is, \\[ \\left( \\bar{x}_{1} - \\bar{x}_{2} \\right) \\pm t_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, df} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}} } \\] and Test Statistic is, \\[ t^{*} = \\frac{\\left( \\bar{x}_{1} - \\bar{x}_{2} \\right) - d_{0}} {\\left( \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}} } \\right )} \\] Typically it is unlikely that the population variances \\(\\sigma^{2}_{1}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}_{2}\\) are known so we will use sample variances \\(s^{2}_{1}\\) and \\(s^{2}_{2}\\) as estimates. While you may never hand calculate these equations, it is important to see the format, or structure, of the equations. Equation has the same format of \\[ \\mbox{point estimate} \\pm 2*\\mbox{standard error}\\] regardless what it is we’re actually trying to estimate. Thus in a pinch, you can calculate approximate confidence intervals for whatever estimate you are trying to understand, given only the estimate and standard error, even if the computer program does not give it to you easily or directly. 5.3.3 Example: Smoking and BMI We would like to know, is there convincing evidence that the average BMI differs between those who have ever smoked a cigarette in their life compared to those who have never smoked? This example uses the Addhealth dataset. 1. Identify response and explanatory variables. The quantitative response variable is BMI (variable ) The binary explanatory variable is whether the person has ever smoked a cigarette (variable ) 2. Visualize and summarize bivariate relationship. ⚠️ Using na.omit() is dangerous! This will remove ALL rows with ANY missing data in it. Regardless if the missing values are contained in the variables you are interested in. The example below employs a trick/work around to not have NA values show in the output. We take the data set addhealth and then select the variables we want to plot, and then we use na.omit() to delete all rows with missing data. Then that is saved as a new, temporary data frame specifically named for this case (plot.bmi.smoke). note for later.

Nonsmokers have more variation in their BMIs (sd 7.8 v. 7.3 and IQR 9.98 v. 9.02), but the distributions both look normal, if slightly skewed right. 3. Write the relationship you want to examine in the form of a research question. Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between BMI and smoking status. Alternate Hypothesis: There is a relationship between BMI and smoking status. 4. Perform an appropriate statistical analysis. I. Let \\(\\mu_1\\) denote the average BMI for nonsmokers, and \\(\\mu_2\\) the average BMI for smokers. \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\) There is no difference in the average BMI between smokers and nonsmokers. \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0\\) There is a difference in the average BMI between smokers and nonsmokers. We are comparing the means between two independent samples. A Two-Sample T-Test for a difference in means will be conducted. The assumptions that the groups are independent is upheld because each individual can only be either a smoker or nonsmoker. The difference in sample means \\(\\bar{x_1} - \\bar{x_2}\\) is normally distributed – this is a valid assumption due to the large sample size and that differences typically are normally distributed. The observations are independent, and the variability is roughly equal (IQR 9.9 v. 9.0). We use the t.test function, but use model notation of the format outcome \\(\\sim\\) category. Here, BMI is our continuous outcome that we’re testing across the (binary) categorical predictor eversmoke_c. t.test(BMI ~ eversmoke_c, data=addhealth) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: BMI by eversmoke_c ## t = 3.6937, df = 3395.3, p-value = 0.0002245 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.3906204 1.2744780 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Non Smoker mean in group Smoker ## 29.67977 28.84722 We have very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, \\(p = 0.0002\\). 5. Write a conclusion in the context of the problem. On average, nonsmokers have a significantly higher BMI by 0.83 (0.39, 1.27) compared to nonsmokers (\\(p = 0.0002\\)). ⚠️ Always check the output against the direction you are testing. R always will calculate a difference as group 1 - group 2, and it defines the groups alphabetically. For example, for a factor variable that has groups A and B, R will automatically calculate the difference as A-B. In this example it is Nonsmoker - Smoker. "],
["bv-anova.html", "5.4 (Q~C) Multiple means: ANOVA", " 5.4 (Q~C) Multiple means: ANOVA Frequently, a researcher wants to compare the means of an outcome across three or more treatments in a single experiment. We might initially think to do pairwise comparisons (1v2, 1v3, 2v3) for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by chance, even if there is no difference in the populations. When we analyze a conventional two-treatment experiment, we are prepared to run a 1 in 20 risk of an apparently significant result arising purely by accident (the 5% chance of a Type I error). We regard such a risk as being fairly unlikely and feel justified in accepting with confidence any significant results we obtain. Analyzing a single experiment as a series of 10 treatment pairs is a very different proposition. The chance of an apparently significant result arising purely by chance somewhere in the 10 analyses increases dramatically. Using a 5% error rate, the chance of NOT making at Type I error is .95. To not make a Type I error 10 times is \\(.95^{10} = .6\\). That means there is a 40% of making a Type I error! 5.4.0.1 Example: Visual Comparison Examine the figure below. Compare groups I, II, and III. Can you visually determine if the differences in the group centers is due to chance or not? What about groups IV, V, and VI? Side-by-side dot plot for the outcomes for six groups. So we need some method of comparing treatments for more than two groups at a time. This is done using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model. ### Terminology Response Variable: The response variable in the ANOVA setting is the quantitative (continuous) variable that we want to compare among the different treatments. Factor/Treatment: A property or characteristic (categorical variable) that allows us to distinguish the different populations from one another. An independent variable to be studied in an investigation such as temperature, type of plant, color of flower, location. Factor/Treatment level: Factors have different levels, such as 3 temperatures, 5 locations, 3 colors, etc. Within-sample Variation: Variation within a sample from one population. Individuals who receive the same treatment will experience identical experimental conditions. The variation within each of the treatment groups must therefore be a consequence of solely random variation. Between-sample Variation: Variation between samples. This is the difference between the group means. If some treatments are genuinely more effective than others, then we would expect to see relatively large differences between the treatment means and a relatively large between-treatments variation. 5.4.1 Formulation of the One-way ANOVA model ANOVA is a mathematical technique which uses a model based approach to partition the variance in an experiment into different sources of variance. This technique enables us to test if most the variation in the treatment means is due to differences between the groups. Starting with our generic conceptual understanding of statistical models: DATA = MODEL + RESIDUAL our MODEL for this situation is the group membership. Does knowing what group an observation is in tell you about the location of the data? The one-way (or one-factor) ANOVA model is \\[ y_{ij} = \\mu_{i} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\qquad \\qquad \\epsilon_{ij} \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}) \\] for \\(i=1, \\ldots, I\\) factor levels and \\(j = 1, \\ldots, n_{i}\\) subjects within each factor level. The random error terms are independently and identically distributed (iid) normally with common variance. The null and alternative hypotheses are always phrased as follows: \\(H_0\\): The mean outcome is the same across all groups. \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_k\\) \\(H_A\\): At least one mean is different. How do we compare means using an ANalysis Of VAriance? By comparing the portion of the variance in the outcome that is explained by the groups, to the portion that’s leftover due to unexplained randomness. Essentially we’re comparing the ratio of MODEL to RESIDUAL. The total variation of the observed data is broken down into 2 parts: Total Variation = Between Group Variation + Within Group Variation Variation is measured using the Sum of Squares (SS): The sum of the squares within a group (SSE), the sum of squares between groups (SSG), and the total sum of squares (SST). SSG (Between groups): Measures the variation of the \\(I\\) group means around the overall mean. \\[ SSG = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{i}(\\bar{y}_{i.}-\\bar{y}..)^{2} = n_{1}(\\bar{y}_{1.}-\\bar{y}..)^{2} + n_{2}(\\bar{y}_{2.}-\\bar{y}..)^{2} + n_{3}(\\bar{y}_{3.}-\\bar{y}..)^{2} \\] SSE (Within group): Measures the variation of each observation around its group mean. \\[ SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{i.})^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}(n_{i}-1)Var(Y_{i}) \\] SST (Total): Measures the variation of the \\(N\\) data points around the overall mean. \\[ SST = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{i}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}..)^{2} = (N-1)Var(Y) \\] 5.4.2 Analysis of Variance Tabl*: The results of an analysis of variance test are always summarized in an ANOVA table. The format of an ANOVA table is as follows: Source SS df MS F Groups SSG \\(I-1\\) MSG = \\(\\frac{SSG}{I-1}\\) \\(\\frac{MSG}{MSE}\\) Error SSE \\(N-I\\) MSE = \\(\\frac{MSG}{N-I}\\) Total SST \\(N-1\\) 5.4.3 The F-distribution The \\(p\\)-value of the test is the area to the right of the F statistic density curve. This is always to the right because the F-distribution is not symmetric, truncated at 0 and skewed right. This is true regardless of the \\(df\\). 5.4.4 Assumptions Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA: The observations are independent within and across groups The data within each group are nearly normal The variability across the groups is about equal. When these three conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the \\(\\mu_i\\) are equal. 5.4.5 Example: A comparison of plant species under low water conditions The PLANTS1 data file gives the percent of nitrogen in four different species of plants grown in a laboratory. The researchers collected these data in parts of the country where there is very little rainfall. To examine the effect of water, they varied the amount per day from 50mm to 650mm in 100mm increments. There were 9 plants per species-by-water combination. Because the plants are to be used primarily for animal food, with some parts that can be consumed by people, a high nitrogen content is very desirable. Let’s formally test to see if the nitrogen content in the plants differ across species. 1. Identify response and explanatory variables. The quantitative response variable is % nitrogen (pctnit) The categorical explanatory variable is species (species) 2. Visualize and summarize bivariate relationship. plot.nitrogen.species &lt;- plants1 %&gt;% select(species, pctnit) %&gt;% na.omit() ggplot(plot.nitrogen.species, aes(x=species, y = pctnit, fill=species)) + geom_boxplot(width=.3) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + labs(x=&quot;Species&quot;) + scale_fill_viridis_d(guide=FALSE) + stat_summary(fun.y=&quot;mean&quot;, geom=&quot;point&quot;, size=3, pch=17, position=position_dodge(width=0.75)) plot.nitrogen.species %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(mean=mean(pctnit, na.rm=TRUE), sd = sd(pctnit, na.rm=TRUE), IQR = IQR(pctnit, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% kable() species mean sd IQR 1 3.039810 0.2506118 0.2690 2 2.092841 0.2377523 0.2725 3 3.284365 0.3218599 0.5065 4 1.195587 0.2342217 0.3125 While the standard deviations are relatively similar across all species, the means are different (3.04 v. 2.09 v. 3.28 v. 1.20), with species 3 having the largest mean nitrogen content and species 4 the smallest. Species 3 has the highest IQR and species 1 has the lowest 0.506 v. 0.269). 3. Write the relationship you want to examine in the form of a research question. Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the average nitrogen content among plant species 1 through 4. Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in the average nitrogen content among plant species 1 through 4. 4. Perform an appropriate statistical analysis. I. Let \\(\\mu_{1}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\mu_{4}\\) be the mean nitrogen content in plant species 1 through 4 respectively. \\(H_{0}: \\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = \\mu_{3} = \\mu_{4}\\) \\(H_{A}:\\) At least one mean is different. We are comparing means from multiple groups, so an ANOVA is the appropriate procedure. We need to check for independence, approximate normality and approximately equal variances across groups. Independence: We are assuming that each plant was sampled independently of each other, and that the species themselves are independent of each other. Normality: With grouped data it’s easier to look at the histograms than qqplots. ggplot(plants1, aes(x=pctnit, fill=species)) + ylab(&quot;&quot;) + geom_density() + facet_grid(species~.) + theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) + scale_fill_viridis_d() The distributions per group tend to follow an approximate normal distribution. Equal variances: One way to assess if the groups have approximately equal variances is by comparing the IQR across groups. plants1 %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(IQR = IQR(pctnit), SD = sd(pctnit)) %&gt;% kable() species IQR SD 1 0.2690 0.2506118 2 0.2725 0.2377523 3 0.5065 0.3218599 4 0.3125 0.2342217 The IQRs are similar so assumption of equal variances is not grossly violated. We can proceed with the ANOVA procedure. We use the aov(response $\\sim$ predictor) function on the relationship between the nitrogen levels and tree species. We then pipe in summary() to make the output display nicely. aov(pctnit~species, data=plants1) %&gt;% summary() ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## species 3 172.39 57.46 827.5 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 248 17.22 0.07 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 5. Write a conclusion in the context of the problem. The results of the ANOVA test indicate that at least one species has a different average nitrogen content than the other varieties (\\(p&lt;\\).001). 5.4.6 Coefficient of determination \\(R^{2}\\) The coefficient of determination is defined as \\(R^{2} = \\frac{SSG}{SST}\\) and can be interpreted as the % of the variation seen in the outcome that is due to subject level variation within each of the treatment groups. The strength of this measure can be thought of in a similar manner as the correlation coefficient \\(r\\): \\(&lt; .3\\) indicates a poor fit, \\(&lt; .5\\) indicates a medium fit, and \\(&gt; .7\\) indicates a good fit. 172.39/(172.39+17.22)*100 ## [1] 90.9182 A large amount (91%) of the variation seen in nitrogen content in the plant can be explained by the species of plant. 5.4.7 Multiple Comparisons Suppose that an ANOVA test reveals that there is a difference in at least one of the means. How can we determine which groups are significantly different without increasing our chance of a Type I error? Simple! We perform all the pairwise comparisons but using a test statistic that retains a family-wise error rate of 0.05 (or our chosen \\(\\alpha\\)). There are different methods to adjust for multiple comparisons, we will be using the Tukey HSD (honest significant difference) test. Continuing on with the analysis of nitrogen across plant species. TukeyHSD(aov(pctnit~species, data=plants1)) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = pctnit ~ species, data = plants1) ## ## $species ## diff lwr upr p adj ## 2-1 -0.9469683 -1.0684156 -0.8255209 0.0e+00 ## 3-1 0.2445556 0.1231082 0.3660029 2.4e-06 ## 4-1 -1.8442222 -1.9656696 -1.7227748 0.0e+00 ## 3-2 1.1915238 1.0700764 1.3129712 0.0e+00 ## 4-2 -0.8972540 -1.0187014 -0.7758066 0.0e+00 ## 4-3 -2.0887778 -2.2102252 -1.9673304 0.0e+00 The results from Tukey’s HSD for all pairwise comparisons indicate that the average nitrogen content in one species is significantly different from each of the three other species. The nice benefit of this procedure is that the difference between the means of the two groups are compared, and a 95confidence interval for each difference is included. So specifically, species 2 has on average 0.94 (0.82, 1.09) lower percent nitrogen compared to species 1 (\\(p&lt;.0001\\)). Also, species 3 has on average 1.19 (1.07, 1.31) higher percent nitrogen compared to species 2 (\\(p&lt;.0001\\)). "],
["bv-chisq.html", "5.5 (C~C) Multiple Proportions: \\(\\chi^{2}\\)", " 5.5 (C~C) Multiple Proportions: \\(\\chi^{2}\\) Recall that the point estimates for the proportion of an event occurring is \\(\\frac{x}{n}\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of times the event occurs out of \\(n\\) records. In this section we we would like to make conclusions about the difference in two population proportions: \\(p_1 - p_2\\). In other words we’re testing the hypothesis that \\(p_{1}-p_{2}=0\\). Our estimate for the difference in proportions based on the sample is \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\). No surprise there. What is slightly different is that we use a pooled proportion to check the condition of normality, and to calculate the standard error of the estimate. This pooled proportion is calculated by pooling the number of events in both groups, divided by the effective sample size for those groups. \\[ \\hat{p} = \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \\] Then the standard error of the point estimate is calculated as \\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_2}} \\] So the equations for the Confidence Interval for the difference in proportions is, \\[ \\left( \\hat{p}_{1} - \\hat{p}_{2} \\right) \\pm t_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, df} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_2}} \\] with test statistic, \\[ t^{*} = \\frac{\\left( \\hat{p}_{1} - \\hat{p}_{2} \\right) - d_{0}} {\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_2}} \\right )} \\] 5.5.1 Conditions for the sampling distribution to be normal. The difference \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) tends to follow a normal model when 1) each proportion separately follows a normal model, and 2) the two samples are independent of each other. #1 can be verified by checking the success-failure condition for each group. That means: \\(\\hat{p}n_{1} \\geq 10\\), AND \\(\\hat{p}n_{2} \\geq 10\\), AND \\(\\hat{q}n_{1} \\geq 10\\), AND \\(\\hat{q}n_{1} \\geq 10\\). Where, if I’ve forgotten to mention it yet, \\(q = 1-p\\). When sample sizes are below 10, but still not super small, say like 5, we turn to the non-parameteric version of this test called a Fisher’s Exact Test. 5.5.2 Example: Are Mammograms effective? This example comes from the OpenIntro Statistics textbook (3rd ed). A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. (Miller AB. 2014) During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we’ll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in the following table. Alive Dead Sum Control 44405 505 44910 Mammogram 44425 500 44925 Sum 88830 1005 89835 The independent/explanatory variable is treatment (additional mammograms), and the dependent/response variable is death from breast cancer. Are these measures associated? If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group (there is a relationship). On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see no difference in breast cancer deaths in the two groups (there is no relationship). What we need to do is to figure out how many deaths would be expected, if there was no relationship between treatment death by breast cancer, and then examine the residuals - the difference between the observed (\\(O_{ij}\\)) and expected (\\(E_{ij}\\)). In our DATA = MODEL + RESIDUAL framework, the DATA is the observed counts \\(O_{ij}\\), and the MODEL is the expected counts \\(E_{ij}\\). To see how the expected counts are calculated, we need to define a few more symbols, so we can find our way around the cells of a table. Just like rows and columns in a matrix, rows are indexed first (as \\(i\\) and columns indexed as \\(j\\)). So the cell in the top left is \\(i=1\\) and \\(j=1\\). \\(O_{ij}\\) Alive Dead Total Mammo \\(n_{11}\\) \\(n_{12}\\) \\(n_{1.}\\) Control \\(n_{21}\\) \\(n_{22}\\) \\(n_{2.}\\) Total \\(n_{.1}\\) \\(n_{.2}\\) \\(N\\) The expected count for each cell is calculated as the row total times the column total for that cell, divided by the overall total. Yes this will end up as a fraction. \\[E_{ij} = \\frac{n_{i.}n_{.j}}{N}\\] Alive Dead Control 44407.58 502.4161 Mammogram 44422.42 502.5839 The residuals are calculated as \\[ RESIDUALS = (O_{ij} - E_{ij})\\] Alive Dead Control -0.0122616 0.1152775 Mammogram 0.0122596 -0.1152583 Examining the residuals can tell us which combinations had counts more or less observations than expected. If mammograms were not associated with survival, there were 0.01 fewer people still alive than expected, and 0.11 more people dead. This is trivially small (2 x 2) example with very large sample sizes. There will be another example provided later. The \\(\\chi^2\\) test statistic is defined as the sum of the squared residuals, divided by the expected counts, and follows a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom (#rows -1)(#cols -1). \\[ \\sum_{ij}\\frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^{2}}{E_{ij}} \\] Like every other statistical test, large values of test statistics correspond to low p-values. Below is a picture of the distribution for the current example. The p-value is reported on the left (vertically), the purple shaded area denotes the rejection region if we were using a hard cutoff of 0.05. (The rejection region is the area where the test statistic had to be at for a p-value to be smaller than .05.). For this example the test statistic was 0.017, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.895. Thus, this study does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that mammograms decrease the rate of deaths by breast cancer. 5.5.3 Example: Smoking and General Health More often than not, we will have the full data available. That is, data at each individual record not just a summary table like in the previous example. Let’s work through an example. Using the Addhealth data set, what can we say about the relationship between smoking and a person’s perceived general level of general health? 1. Identify response and explanatory variables. The binary explanatory variable is whether the person has ever smoked an entire cigarette (eversmoke_c) The categorical explanatory variable is the person’s general health (genhealth) and has levels “Excellent”, “Very Good”, “Good”, “Fair”, and “Poor”. 2. Visualize and summarise bivariate relationship. sjPlot::plot_xtab(grp=addhealth$eversmoke_c, x=addhealth$genhealth, show.total = FALSE, margin=&quot;row&quot;, legend.title=&quot;&quot;) The percentage of smokers seems to increase as the general health status decreases. Almost three-quarters (73%, n=40) of those reporting poor health have smoked an entire cigarette at least once in their life compared to 59% (n=573) of those reporting excellent health. 3. Write the relationship you want to examine in the form of a research question. Is the proportion of those who have ever smoked equal across all levels of general health? Null Hypothesis: The proportion of smokers in each general health category is the same. Alternate Hypothesis: At least one proportion is different. 4. Perform an appropriate statistical analysis. I. Define the parameters under consideration. Let \\(p_{1}\\) be the true proportion of smokers within the ``Excellent\" health category. Let \\(p_{2}\\) be the true proportion of smokers within the ``Very good\" health category. Let \\(p_{3}\\) be the true proportion of smokers within ``Good\" health category. Let \\(p_{4}\\) be the true proportion of smokers within ``Fair\" health category. Let \\(p_{5}\\) be the true proportion of smokers within ``Poor\" health category. \\(H_{0}: p_{1} = p_{2} = p_{3} = p_{4} = p_{5}\\) \\(H_{A}:\\) At least one proportion is different. I will conduct a \\(\\chi\\)-squared test of association. There is at least 10 observations in each combination of smoking status and general health. Conduct the test. health.smoke.model &lt;- chisq.test(addhealth$genhealth, addhealth$eversmoke_c) health.smoke.model ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: addhealth$genhealth and addhealth$eversmoke_c ## X-squared = 30.795, df = 4, p-value = 3.371e-06 We have strong evidence against the null; the \\(p\\)-value is less than .0001. 5. Write a conclusion in context of the problem. We can conclude that there is an association between ever smoking a cigarette in their life and perceived general health (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 30.8, df=4, \\(p&lt;.0001\\)). 5.5.4 Multiple Comparisons Just like with ANOVA, if we find that the chi-squared test indicates that at least one proportion is different from the others, it’s our job to figure out which ones might be different! We will analyze the residuals to accomplish this. Not by hand! Never again! You’re not learning how to code for nothing. The residuals are automatically stored in the model output. You can either print them out and look at the values directly: health.smoke.model$residuals ## addhealth$eversmoke_c ## addhealth$genhealth Non Smoker Smoker ## Excellent 3.4461139 -2.5168277 ## Very good 0.4810893 -0.3513578 ## Good -2.4431255 1.7843072 ## Fair -1.0556365 0.7709714 ## Poor -0.9446378 0.6899048 Or you can extract them and save them as a data frame. Then use ggplot with geom_raster to fill in your squares. plot.residuals &lt;- health.smoke.model$residuals %&gt;% data.frame() ggplot(plot.residuals, aes(x=addhealth.genhealth, y=addhealth.eversmoke_c)) + geom_raster(aes(fill=Freq)) + scale_fill_viridis_c() The proportion of those who have never smoked and report being in Excellent health is higher than expected if these two measures were independent (high positive residual means observed is greater than expected). A lower percent of people reporting Good health never smoked, which is lower than expected if smoking and health status were independent. So these two categories are likely to be the groups that have a different proportion of lifetime smoker \\(p_{i}\\) compared to the other groups. "],

["reg-intro.html", "Chapter 6 Introduction", " Chapter 6 Introduction The general purpose of regression is to learn more about the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a quantitative dependent variable. Multiple regression procedures are very widely used in research.

Sociologists may want to find out which of the multiple social indicators best predict whether or not a new immigrant group will adapt to their new country of residence. Biologists may want to find out which factors (i.e. temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, etc.) best predict caterpillar reproduction.

So overall, is employment status associated with depression? Recall that employment is a categorical variable, and all the coefficient estimates shown are the effect of being in that income category has on depression compared to being employed full time. For example, the coefficient for PT employment is greater than zero, so they have a higher CESD score compared to someone who is fully employed. But what about employment status overall? Not all employment categories are significantly different from FT status.

["moderation.html", "9.3 Moderation", " 9.3 Moderation Moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The third variable is referred to as the moderating variable or simply the moderator. The moderator affects the direction and/or strength of the relationship between the explanatory (\\(x\\)) and response (\\(y\\)) variable. This tends to be an important When testing a potential moderator, we are asking the question whether there is an association between two constructs, but separately for different subgroups within the sample. This is also called a stratified model, or a subgroup analysis. Here are 3 scenarios demonstrating how a third variable can modify the relationship between the original two variables. Scenario 1 - Significant relationship at bivariate level (saying expect the effect to exist in the entire population) then when test for moderation the third variable is a moderator if the strength (i.e., p-value is Non-Significant) of the relationship changes. Could just change strength for one level of third variable, not necessarily all levels of the third variable. Scenario 2 - Non-significant relationship at bivariate level (saying do not expect the effect to exist in the entire population) then when test for moderation the third variable is a moderator if the relationship becomes significant (saying expect to see it in at least one of the sub-groups or levels of third variable, but not in entire population because was not significant before tested for moderation). Could just become significant in one level of the third variable, not necessarily all levels of the third variable. Scenario 3 - Significant relationship at bivariate level (saying expect the effect to exist in the entire population) then when test for moderation the third variable is a moderator if the direction (i.e., means change order/direction) of the relationship changes. Could just change direction for one level of third variable, not necessarily all levels of the third variable.

The correlation coefficient \\(r\\) for virginica and veriscolor are similar to the overall \\(r\\) value, 0.86 and 0.75 respectively compared to 0.87. However the correlation between sepal and petal length for species setosa is only 0.26. The points are clearly clustered by species, the slope of the lowess line between virginica and versicolor appear similar in strength, whereas the slope of the line for setosa is closer to zero. This would imply that petal length for Setosa may not be affected by the length of the sepal. 9.3.2 Example 2: Simpson’s Paradox Sometimes moderating variables can result in what’s known as Simpson’s Paradox https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox "],

["glm.html", "Chapter 10 Generalized Linear Models", " Chapter 10 Generalized Linear Models One of the primary assumptions with linear regression, is that the error terms have a specific distribution.

Generalized Linear Models (GLM) allows for different data type outcomes by allowing the linear portion of the model (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\beta\\)) to be related to the outcome variable \\(y\\) using a link function, that allows the magnitude of the variance of the errors (\\(\\sigma\\)) to be related to the predicted values themselves. There are three overarching types of non-continuous outcomes that can be modeled with GLM’s.

Consider an outcome variable \\(Y\\) with two levels: Y = 1 if event, = 0 if no event. Let \\(p_{i} = P(y_{i}=1)\\). The logistic model relates the probability of an event based on a linear combination of X’s. \\[ log\\left( \\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}} \\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1i} + \\beta_{2}x_{2i} + \\ldots + \\beta_{p}x_{pi} \\] Since the odds are defined as the probability an event occurs divided by the probability it does not occur: \\((p/(1-p))\\), the function \\(log\\left(\\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\\right)\\) is also known as the log odds, or more commonly called the logit.

The probability of depression for a male of equal age and income is 0.86. 10.3.1 Calculating predictions So what if you want to get the model predicted probability of the event for all individuals in the data set? There’s no way I’m doing that calculation for every person in the data set. Using the main effects model from above, stored in the object mvmodel, we can call the predict() command to generate a vector of predictions for each row used in the model. Any row with missing data on any variable used in the model will NOT get a predicted value. The predict() function can calculate predictions for any GLM. The model object mvmodel stores the information that it was a logistic regression. model.pred.prob &lt;- predict(mvmodel, type=&#39;response&#39;) head(model.pred.prob) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.21108906 0.08014012 0.15266203 0.24527840 0.15208679 0.17056409 10.3.1.1 Distribution of Predictions How well does our model do to predict depression? plot.mpp &lt;- data.frame(prediction = model.pred.prob, truth = factor(mvmodel$y, labels=c(&quot;Not Depressed&quot;, &quot;Depressed&quot;))) ggplot(plot.mpp, aes(x=truth, y=prediction, fill=truth)) + geom_jitter(width=.2) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + theme_bw() What things can you infer from this plot? Where should we put the cutoff value? At what probability should we classify a record as “depressed”? 10.3.1.2 Optimal Cutoff Value Often we adjust the cutoff value to improve accuracy. This is where we have to put our gut feeling of what probability constitutes “high risk”. For some models, this could be as low as 30%. It’s whatever the probability is that optimally separates the classes. Let’s look at two ways to visualize model performance as a function of cutoff. 10.3.2 ROC Curves We can create a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to help find that sweet spot. ROC curves show the balance between sensitivity and specificity. We’ll use the [ROCR] package. It only takes 3 commands: calculate prediction() using the model calculate the model performance() on both true positive rate and true negative rate for a whole range of cutoff values. plot the curve. The colorize option colors the curve according to the probability cutoff point. library(ROCR) pr &lt;- prediction(model.pred.prob, mvmodel$y) perf &lt;- performance(pr, measure=&quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure=&quot;fpr&quot;) plot(perf, colorize=TRUE, lwd=3, print.cutoffs.at=c(seq(0,1,by=0.1))) abline(a=0, b=1, lty=2) We can also use the performance() function and say we want to evaluate the \\(f1\\) measure perf.f1 &lt;- performance(pr,measure=&quot;f&quot;) plot(perf.f1) ROC curves: Can also be used for model comparison: http://yaojenkuo.io/diamondsROC.html The Area under the Curve (auc) also gives you a measure of overall model accuracy. auc &lt;- performance(pr, measure=&#39;auc&#39;) auc@y.values ## [[1]] ## [1] 0.695041 10.3.3 Model Performance Say we decide that a value of 0.15 is our optimal cutoff value. We can use this probability to classify each row into groups. The assigned class values must match the data type and levels of the true value. It also has to be in the same order, so the 0 group needs to come first. Then we calculate a [Confusion Matrix] using the similarly named function from the caret package. At it’s core, this is a 2x2 table containing counts of each combination of predicted value and true value. library(caret) plot.mpp$pred.class &lt;- ifelse(plot.mpp$prediction &lt;0.15, 0,1) plot.mpp$pred.class &lt;- factor(plot.mpp$pred.class, labels=c(&quot;Not Depressed&quot;, &quot;Depressed&quot;)) confusionMatrix(plot.mpp$pred.class, plot.mpp$truth, positive=&quot;Depressed&quot;) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction Not Depressed Depressed ## Not Depressed 123 10 ## Depressed 121 40 ## ## Accuracy : 0.5544 ## 95% CI : (0.4956, 0.6121) ## No Information Rate : 0.8299 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 1 ## ## Kappa : 0.1615 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : &lt;2e-16 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.8000 ## Specificity : 0.5041 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.2484 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.9248 ## Prevalence : 0.1701 ## Detection Rate : 0.1361 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.5476 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.6520 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : Depressed ## 123 people were correctly predicted to not be depressed (True Negative, \\(n_{11}\\)) 121 people were incorrectly predicted to be depressed (False Positive, \\(n_{21}\\)) 10 people were incorrectly predicted to not be depressed (False Negative, \\(n_{12}\\)) 40 people were correctly predicted to be depressed (True Positive, \\(n_{22}\\)) Other terminology: Sensitivity/Recall/True positive rate: P(predicted positive | total positive) = 40/(10+40) = .8 Specificity/true negative rate: P(predicted negative | total negative) = 123/(123+121) = .504 Precision/positive predicted value: P(true positive | predicted positive) = 40/(121+40) = .2484 Accuracy: (TP + TN)/ Total: (40 + 123)/(40+123+121+10) = .5544 Balanced Accuracy: \\([(n_{11}/n_{.1}) + (n_{22}/n_{.2})]/2\\) - This is to adjust for class size imbalances (like in this example) F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Plot of Histogram of a Poisson Distribution with a Mean of 5 and a Normal Curve 10.5.0.1 Poisson Regression Just another GLM - we use a \\(ln\\) as the link function. This lets us model the log rates using a linear combination of covariates. \\[ ln(\\mu) = \\mathbf{X}\\beta \\] Then the expected rate of events per unit of time is: \\[ \\mu = e^{\\mathbf{X}\\beta} \\] This model assumes that the time of “exposure” for each record is identical. Number of cigarettes per month Number of epileptic seizures per week Number of people with lung cancer in four cities If this is not the case (often), then this model needs to include an offset. e.g. observing each patient for epileptic seizures for a different number of days accounting for different sizes or structures of populations of interest (e.g. different cities with lung cancer) What actually gets fit in glm is the model of expected counts, rather than rates, with an offset for the time period \\(T\\). If all time periods are the same, then T is constant, and a linear combination of the intercept, thus dropped from the model. \\[ ln(\\lambda) = \\mathbf{X}\\beta + ln(T) \\] While this offset will be added to the regression model as if it were another variable, it’s not quite the same because the regression coefficient for the \\(ln(T)\\) term is fixed at 1. The generic formula for fitting a poisson model using glm is: glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + offset(log(T)), family=&#39;poisson&#39;) or alternatively as an argument glm(y ~ x1 + x2, offset = log(T), family=&#39;poisson&#39;) The interpretation of the \\(\\beta\\) regression coefficients are differences in the log rate (or the log rate-ratio). So, just like with a logistic regression often we back-transform the coefficients by exponentiating before interpreting. So \\(e^{\\beta}\\) is now the rate-ratio. The intercept term is not a ratio, but a baseline rate when all covariates are 0 For other covariates, the coefficient is the relative change per unit change in the covariate. one year older males vs females Also, similar to logistic regression, since the outcome was transformed, the standard errors are not useful or interpretable as is. To calculate confidence intervals for the rate ratios, calculate the CI for \\(\\beta\\) exponentiate each end point. 10.5.0.2 Example: Modeling counts from the Add Health data Wave IVset. better example forthcoming Let’s model the number of siblings someone has, based off their age at Wave 1 (2008).

NMAR: most difficult to handle. Evidence? What can we learn from evidence in the data set at hand? May be evidence in the data rule out MCAR - test responders vs. nonresponders. Example: Responders tend to have higher/lower average education than nonresponders by t-test Example: Response more likely in one geographic area than another by chi-square test No evidence in data set to rule out MAR (although there may be evidence from an external data source) What is plausible? Cochran example: when human behavior is involved, MCAR must be viewed as an extremely special case that would often be violated in practice Missing data may be introduced by design (e.g., measure some variables, don’t measure others for reasons of cost, response burden), in which case MCAR would apply MAR is much more common than MCAR We cannot be too cavalier about assuming MAR, but anecdotal evidence shows that it often is plausible when conditioning on enough information Ignorable Missing If missing-data mechanism is MCAR or MAR then nonresponse is said to be “ignorable”. Origin of name: in likelihood-based inference, both the data model and missing-data mechanism are important but with MCAR or MAR, inference can be based solely on the data model, thus making inference much simpler “Ignorability” is a relative assumption: missingness on income may be NMAR given only gender, but may be MAR given gender, age, occupation, region of the country "],

Imputation procedures: fill in missing values, then analyze completed data sets using complete-date methods Weighting procedures: modify “design weights” (i.e., inverse probabilities of selection from sampling plan) to account for probability of response Model-based approaches: develop model for partially missing data, base inferences on likelihood under that model 14.4.1 Complete cases analysis If not all variables observed, delete case from analysis Advantages: Simplicity Common sample for all estimates Disadvantages: Loss of valid information Bias due to violation of MCAR 14.4.2 Available-case analysis Use all cases where the variable of interest is present Potentially different sets of cases for means of X and Y and complete pairs for \\(r_{XY}\\) Tempting to think that available-case analysis will be superior to complete-case analysis But it can distort relationships between variables by not using a common base of observations for all quantities being estimated. 14.4.3 Imputation Fill in missing values, analyze completed data set Advantage: Rectangular data set easier to analyze Disadvantage: “Both seductive and dangerous” (Little and Rubin) Can understate uncertainty due to missing values.

For predictors that are incomplete themselves, the most recently generated imputations are used to complete the predictors prior to imputation of the target column. A separate univariate imputation model can be specified for each column. The default imputation method depends on the measurement level of the target column. Your best reference guide to this section of the notes is the mice: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in R article in the Journal of Statistical Software by Stef van Buuren. https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v045i03 14.7.2 Process / Algorithm Consider a data matrix with 3 variables \\(y_{1}\\), \\(y_{2}\\), \\(y_{3}\\), each with missing values. At iteration \\((\\ell)\\): Fit a model on \\(y_{1}^{(\\ell-1)}\\) using current values of \\(y_{2}^{(\\ell-1)}, y_{3}^{(\\ell-1)}\\) Impute missing \\(y_{1}\\), generating \\(y_{1}^{(\\ell)}\\) Fit a model on \\(y_{2}^{(\\ell-1)}\\) using current versions of \\(y_{1}^{(\\ell)}, y_{3}^{(\\ell-1)}\\) Impute missing \\(y_{2}\\), generating \\(y_{2}^{(\\ell)}\\) Fit a model on \\(y_{3}\\) using current versions of \\(y_{1}^{(\\ell)}, y_{2}^{(\\ell)}\\) Impute missing \\(y_{3}\\), generating \\(y_{3}^{(\\ell)}\\) Start next cycle using updated values \\(y_{1}^{(\\ell)}, y_{2}^{(\\ell)}, y_{3}^{(\\ell)}\\) where \\((\\ell)\\) cycles from 1 to \\(L\\), before an imputed value is drawn. 14.7.3 Convergence How many imputations (\\(m\\)) should we create and how many iterations (\\(L\\)) should I run between imputations? Original research from Rubin states that small amount of imputations (\\(m=5\\)) would be sufficient. Advances in computation have resulted in very efficient programs such as mice - so generating a larger number of imputations (say \\(m=40\\)) are more common Pan, 2016 You want the number of iterations between draws to be long enough that the Gibbs sampler has converged. There is no test or direct method for determing convergence. Plot parameter against iteration number, one line per chain. These lines should be intertwined together, without showing trends. Convergence can be identified when the variance between lines is smaller (or at least no larger) than the variance within the lines.

We will demonstrate using Fisher’s Iris data (pre-built in with R) where we can artificially create a prespecified percent of the data missing. This allows us to be able to estimate the bias incurred by using these imputation methods. For the iris data we set a seed and use the prodNA() function from the missForest package to create 10% missing values in this data set. library(missForest) set.seed(12345) # Note to self: Change the combo on my luggage iris.mis &lt;- prodNA(iris, noNA=0.1) prop.table(table(is.na(iris.mis))) ## ## FALSE TRUE ## 0.9 0.1 Visualize missing data pattern. library(VIM) aggr(iris.mis, col=c(&#39;darkolivegreen3&#39;,&#39;salmon&#39;), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(iris.mis), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c(&quot;Missing data&quot;,&quot;Pattern&quot;)) ## ## Variables sorted by number of missings: ## Variable Count ## Petal.Width 0.14000000 ## Sepal.Length 0.13333333 ## Species 0.11333333 ## Petal.Length 0.06000000 ## Sepal.Width 0.05333333 Here’s another example of where only 10% of the data overall is missing, but it results in only 58% complete cases. 14.8.1 Multiply impute the missing data using mice() imp_iris &lt;- mice(iris.mis, m=10, maxit=25, meth=&quot;pmm&quot;, seed=500, printFlag=FALSE) summary(imp_iris) ## Class: mids ## Number of multiple imputations: 10 ## Imputation methods: ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; &quot;pmm&quot; ## PredictorMatrix: ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## Sepal.Length 0 1 1 1 1 ## Sepal.Width 1 0 1 1 1 ## Petal.Length 1 1 0 1 1 ## Petal.Width 1 1 1 0 1 ## Species 1 1 1 1 0 The Stack Exchange post listed below has a great explanation/description of what each of these arguments control.

["final-thoughts.html", "14.9 Final thoughts", " 14.9 Final thoughts “In our experience with real and artificial data…, the practical conclusion appears to be that multiple imputation, when carefully done, can be safely used with real problems even when the ultimate user may be applying models or analyses not contemplated by the imputer.” - Little &amp; Rubin (Book, p. 218) Don’t ignore missing data. Impute sensibly and multiple times. It’s typically desirable to include many predictors in an imputation model, both to improve precision of imputed values make MAR assumption more plausible But the number of covariance parameters goes up as the square of the number of variables in the model, implying practical limits on the number of variables for which parameters can be estimated well MI applies to subjects who have a general missingness pattern, i.e., they have measurements on some variables, but not on others. But, subjects can be lost to follow up due to death or other reasons (i.e., attrition). Here we have only baseline data, but not the outcome or other follow up data. If attrition subjects are eliminated from the sample, they can produce non-response or attrition bias. Use attrition weights. Given a baseline profile, predict the probability that subject will stay and use the inverse probability as weight. e.g., if for a given profile all subjects stay, then the predicted probability is 1 and the attrition weight is 1. Such a subject “counts once”. For another profile, the probability may be 0.5, attrition weight is 1/.5 = 2 and that person “counts twice”. For differential drop-out, or self-selected treatment, you can consider using Propensity Scores. "],
