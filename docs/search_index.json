One of the most misunderstood parts of the analysis process is the data preparation stage. To say that 70% of any analysis is spent on the data management stage is not an understatement. This chapter provides information on topics related to data processing and corresponds to PMA6 Chapter 3. "],["reproducible-workflows.html", "1.1 Reproducible workflows", " 1.1 Reproducible workflows Reproducibility is the ability for any researcher to take the same data set and run the same set of software program instructions as another researcher and achieve the same results. The goal is to create an exact record of what was done to a data set to produce a specific result. To achieve reproducibility, we believe that three things must be present: The un-processed data are connected directly to software code file(s) that perform data preparation techniques. The processed data are connected directly to other software code file(s) that perform the analyses. All data and code files are self-contained such that they could be given to another researcher to execute the code commands on a separate computer and achieve the same results as the original author. PrepareData Why do we need a codebook? You are your own collaborator 6 months from now. Make sure you will be able to understand what you were doing. Investing the time to do things clearly and in a reproducible manner will make your future self happy. Comment your code with explanations and instructions. How did you get from point A to B? Why did you recode this variable in this manner? We need to record those steps (not just for posterity). This means your code must be saved in a script file. Include sufficient notes to yourself describing what you are doing and why. For R, this can be in a .R, .Rmd or .qmd file. I always prefer the latter. For SPSS you can specify to paste the syntax and copy into a .sps script file. For SAS you’ll use a .sas file For STATA this will be a .do file Repro Figure Credits: Roger Peng 1.1.1 Literate programming Programming paradigm introduced by Knuth (1984) Explain the logic of the program or analysis process in a natural language, Small code snippets included at each step act as a full set of instructions that can be executed to reproduce the result/analysis being discussed. Literate programming tools are integrated into most common statistical packages Markdown (R, Stata), Quarto (R, Python, others) \\(\\LaTeX\\) (R, SAS, Stata) The current gold standard for writing reproducible literate documents in R is to use Quarto. This works with Python, julia and other code editing platforms. Practicing reproducible research techniques using literate programming tools allows such major updates to be a simple matter of re-compiling all coded instructions using the updated data set. The effort then is reduced to a careful review and update of any written results. Using literate programming tools create formatted documents section headers bold and italicized words tables and graphics with built-in captions in a streamlined manner that is fully synchronized with the code itself. The author writes the text explanations, interpretations, and code in the statistical software program itself, and the program will execute all commands and combine the text, code and output all together into a final dynamic document. What stages of the pipeline shown above can we conduct using literate programming tools?

Are there codes that indicate missing? E.g. MISSING or -99? Do you need to make response codes more logical? Some systems will record 1=YES and 2=NO. This should be changed to 0=NO. Do you need to recode numerical variables to categorical? Sometimes categorical data will be recorded as 1, 2, 3 etc when those numbers represent named categories. Do you need to create secondary variables such as an average across measures to create a score. Are the variable names user friendly? Mixtures of CAPS and lower case, names with spaces or special characters should all be changed. Some of these answers will come only after you look at your data. This can be looking at the raw data itself but also looking at tables and charts generated from the data.

Often times once you start slicing and dicing the data to only look at certain groups, or if you are interested in the behavior of certain variables across levels of another variable, sometimes you start to run into small sample size problems. For example, consider marital status again. There are only 13 people who report being separated. This could potentially be too small of a group size for valid statistical analysis. One way to deal with insufficient data within a certain category is to collapse categories.

In general, transformations are more effective when the the standard deviation is large relative to the mean. One rule of thumb is if the sd/mean ratio is less than 1/4, a transformation may not be necessary. sd(depress$income) / mean(depress$income) ## [1] 0.743147 Alternatively Hoaglin, Mosteller and Tukey (1985) showed that if the largest observation divided by the smallest observation is over 2, then the data may not be sufficiently variable for the transformation to be decisive. max(depress$income) / (min(depress$income)+.1) ## [1] 30.95238 Note these rules are not meaningful for data without a natural zero. Another common method of assessing normality is to create a normal probability (or normal quantile) plot. qqnorm(depress$income);qqline(depress$income, col=&quot;red&quot;) The points on the normal probability plot do not follow the red reference line very well. The dots show a more curved, or U shaped form rather than following a linear line. This is another indication that the data is skewed and a transformation for normality should be created. Create three new variables: log10inc as the log base 10 of Income, loginc as the natural log of Income, and xincome which is equal to the negative of one divided by the cubic root of income. log10inc &lt;- log10(depress$income) loginc &lt;- log(depress$income) xincome &lt;- -1/(depress$income)^(-1/3) Create a single plot that display normal probability plots for the original, and each of the three transformations of income. Use the base graphics grid organizer par(mfrow=c(r,c)) where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. Which transformation does a better job of normalizing the distribution of Income? par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Try (4,1) and (1,4) to see how this works. qqnorm(depress$income, main=&quot;Income&quot;); qqline(depress$income,col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(log10inc, main=&quot;Log 10&quot;); qqline(log10inc, col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(loginc, main = &quot;Natural Log&quot;); qqline(loginc, col=&quot;blue&quot;) qqnorm(xincome, main=&quot;-1/cuberoot(income)&quot;); qqline(xincome, col=&quot;blue&quot;) "],["export-and-save.html", "1.15 Export and Save", " 1.15 Export and Save You’ve just made a ton of changes!

There are several R packages that can help with this including reshape2 and tidyr. "],["missing-data.html", "1.17 Missing data", " 1.17 Missing data 1.17.1 Identifying missing data In Excel, missing data can show up as a blank cell. In SPSS it is represented as a . period. R displays missing data as NA values. Missing Data in SPSS: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/modules/missing-data/ Why would data be missing? Other than the obvious data entry errors, tech glitches or just non-cooperative plants or people, sometimes values are out of range and you would rather delete them than change their value (data edit). Lets look at the religion variable in the depression data set. table(depress$relig, useNA=&quot;always&quot;) ## ## 1 2 3 4 6 &lt;NA&gt; ## 155 51 30 56 2 0 Looking at the codebook, there is no category 6 for religion. Let’s change all values to NA. depress$relig[depress$relig==6] &lt;- NA This code says take all rows where relig is equal to 6, and change them to NA. Confirm recode. table(depress$relig, useNA=&quot;always&quot;) ## ## 1 2 3 4 &lt;NA&gt; ## 155 51 30 56 2 Notice the use of the useNA=\"always\" argument. If we just looked at the base table without this argument, we would have never known there was missing data! table(depress$relig) ## ## 1 2 3 4 ## 155 51 30 56 What about continuous variables? Well there happens to be no other missing data in this data set, so let’s make up a set of 7 data points stored in a variable named y. y &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 4, NA, 6) y ## [1] 1 2 3 NA 4 NA 6 The #1 way to identify missing data in a continuous variable is by looking at the summary() values. mean(y) ## [1] NA summary(y) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s ## 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.2 4.0 6.0 2 mean(y, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 3.2 In R, any arithmetic function (like addition, multiplication) on missing data results in a missing value. The na.rm=TRUE toggle tells R to calculate the complete case mean. This is a biased measure of the mean, but missing data is a topic worthy of it’s own course and is introduced in Chapter 18. 1.17.2 Model predictions Situation: You want to add model predictions to the data set, but you have missing data that was automatically dropped prior to analysis. 1.17.3 Regression R objects created by methods such as lm and glm will store the data used in the model in the model object itself in model$data. See Chapter 12 for an example. 1.17.4 Factor Analysis and Principle Components If your original data had missing values, here is one way to get the PC’s / factor scores for available data back onto the data set. Method 1) Create an ID column and merge new variables onto original data. (add columns) If no ID column exists, create one on the original dataset id = 1:NROW(data) Use select() to extract the ID and all variables used in the factor analysis, then do a na.omit() to drop rows with any missing data. Save this as a new complete case data set. Conduct PCA / Factor analysis on this new complete case data set (MINUS THE ID). Extract the PCs or factor scores. Use bind_cols() to add the ID variable to the data containing factor scores. Then left_join(original_data, factor_score_data) the factor scores back to the original data, using the ID variable as the joining key. Method 2) Split the data, analyze one part then concatenate back together. (add rows) Use the complete.cases() function to create a boolean vector for if each row is complete Split the data into complete and incomplete. Do the analysis on the complete rows, extracting the PC’s/Factors Add the PC/Factor data onto the complete rows using bind_cols Then bind_rows the two parts back together. cc.idx &lt;- hiv %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;pb&quot;)) %&gt;% complete.cases() # 1 complete.rows &lt;- hiv[cc.idx,] #2 incomplete.rows &lt;- hiv[!cc.idx,] pc.scores &lt;- princomp(pb)$scores #3 complete.add.pc &lt;- bind_cols(complete.rows, pc.scores) #4 hiv.with.pcs &lt;- bind_rows(complete.add.pc, incomplete.rows) #5 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
