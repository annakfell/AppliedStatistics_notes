# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document is a set of course notes for several Applied Statistics courses at California State University, Chico. This is not a textbook replacement, and topics covered will vary depending on the instructor. To make this clear we use the term _notebook_ to refer to this document so as not to be confused with a traditional textbook. 

Some data and examples in this notebook are drawn from _[Practical Multivariate Analysis, 6tth ed, Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781138702226)_ and used with permission by the authors.
