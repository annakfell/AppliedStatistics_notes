# Model Building {#model-building}

Model building methods are used mainly in exploratory situations where many independent variables have been measured, but a final model explaining the dependent variable has not been reached. You want to build a model that contains enough covariates to explain the model well, but still be parsimonious such that the model is still interpretable. 

This chapter introduces how to use and interpret different types of covariates, how to choose covariates, and then cover some methods to compare between competing models using measures of model fit. 


```{block2,  type='rmdnote'}
This section uses functions from the `gtsummary`, and `survey`...packages to help tidy and visualize results from regression models.

## Binary predictors

Does gender also play a roll in FEV? Let's look at the separate effects of height and age on FEV1, and visualize how gender plays a roll. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fev_long <- data.frame(gender = c(fev$FSEX, fev$MSEX), 
                   fev1 = c(fev$FFEV1, fev$MFEV1), 
                   ht = c(fev$FHEIGHT, fev$MHEIGHT), 
                   age = c(fev$FAGE, fev$MAGE))
fev_long$gender <- factor(fev_long$gender, labels=c("M", "F"))
```

```{r, fig.height=4}
ht.plot <- ggplot(fev_long, aes(x=ht, y=fev1)) + 
        geom_point(aes(col=gender)) + 
        geom_smooth(se=FALSE, aes(col=gender), method="lm") + 
        geom_smooth(se=FALSE, col="red", method="lm") + 
        scale_color_viridis_d() + 
        theme(legend.position = c(0.15,0.85))

age.plot <- ggplot(fev_long, aes(x=age, y=fev1)) + 
        geom_point(aes(col=gender)) + 
        geom_smooth(se=FALSE, aes(col=gender), method="lm") + 
        geom_smooth(se=FALSE, col="red", method="lm") + 
        scale_color_viridis_d(guide=FALSE)
        
gridExtra::grid.arrange(ht.plot, age.plot, ncol=2)
```

* The points are colored by gender
* Each gender has it's own best fit line in the same color as the points
* The red line is the best fit line overall - ignoring gender

![q](images/q.png) Is gender a moderator for either height or age? 

Let's compare the models with, and without gender 
```{r}
gmod1 <- lm(fev1 ~ age + ht, data=fev_long)
gmod2 <- lm(fev1 ~ age + ht + gender, data=fev_long)

tbl_merge(
  tbls = list(tbl_regression(gmod1), 
              tbl_regression(gmod2)), 
  tab_spanner = c("**Model 1**", "**Model 2**")
)
```

* Gender is a binary categorical variable, with reference group "Male".
    - This is detected because the variable that shows up in the regression model output is `genderF`. So the estimate shown is for males, compared to females. 
    - More details on how categorical variables are included in multivariable models is covered in section \@ref(cat-predictors). 



**Interpretation of Coefficients**

The regression equation for the model without gender is 

$$ y = -6.74 - 0.02 age + 0.16 height $$

* $b_{0}:$ For someone who is 0 years old and 0 cm tall, their FEV is -6.74L.
* $b_{1}:$ For every additional year older an individual is, their FEV1 decreases by 0.02L. 
* $b_{2}:$ For every additional cm taller an individual is, their FEV1 increases by 0.16L. 


The regression equation for the model with gender is 

$$ y = -2.24 - 0.02 age + 0.11 height - 0.64genderF $$


* $b_{0}:$ For a male who is 0 years old and 0 cm tall, their FEV is -2.24L.
* $b_{1}:$ For every additional year older an individual is, their FEV1 decreases by 0.02L. 
* $b_{2}:$ For every additional cm taller an individual is, their FEV1 increases by 0.16L. 
* $b_{3}:$ Females have 0.64L lower FEV compared to males. 

**Note**: The interpretation of categorical variables still falls under the template language of "for every one unit increase in $X_{p}$, $Y$ changes by $b_{p}$". Here, $X_{3}=0$ for males, and 1 for females. So a 1 "unit" change is females _compared to_ males.

## Categorical Predictors {#cat-predictors}

Let's continue to model the length of the iris petal based on the length of the sepal, controlling for species. But here we'll keep species as a categorical variable. What happens if we just put the variable in the model? 

```{r}
summary(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Species, data=iris))
```

Examine the coefficient names, `Speciesversicolor` and `Speciesvirginica`. R (and most software packages) automatically take a categorical variable and turn it into a series of binary indicator variables. Let's look at what the software program does in the background. Below is a sample of the iris data. The first column shows the row number, specifically I am only showing 2 sample rows from each species. The second column is the value of the sepal length, the third is the binary indicator for if the iris is from species _versicolor_, next the binary indicator for if the iris is from species _virginica_, and lastly the species as a 3 level categorical variable (which is what we're used to seeing at this point.)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- model.matrix(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Species, data=iris)
b <- data.frame(a, Species=iris$Species)[c(1:2,51:52,101:102),-1]
kable(b)
```

### Factor variable coding

* Most commonly known as "Dummy coding". Not an informative term to use. 
* Better used term: Indicator variable
* Math notation: **I(gender == "Female")**. 
* A.k.a reference coding
* For a nominal X with K categories, define K indicator variables.
    - Choose a reference (referent) category:
    - Leave it out
    - Use remaining K-1 in the regression.
    - Often, the largest category is chosen as the reference category.

For the iris example, 2 indicator variables are created for _versicolor_ and _virginica_. Interpreting the regression coefficients are going to be **compared to the reference group**. In this case, it is species _setosa_. 

The mathematical model is now written as follows, where $x_{1}$ is Sepal Length, $x_{2}$ is the indicator for _versicolor_, and $x_{3}$ the indicator for _virginica_ 

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \beta_{3}x_{3i}+ \epsilon_{i}$$

When the species is _setosa_, $x_{2} =0$ and $x_{3}=0$, so the model then is

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}$$

When the species is _versicolor_, $x_{2} =1$ and $x_{3}=0$, so the model then is

$$ 
Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2} + \epsilon_{i} \\
Y_{i} \sim (\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + \beta_{1}x_{i} +  \epsilon_{i}
$$

and similarly for species _virginica_. 

When the species is _virginica_., $x_{2} =0$ and $x_{3}=1$, so the model then is

$$ 
Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{3} + \epsilon_{i} \\
Y_{i} \sim (\beta_{0} + \beta_{3}) + \beta_{1}x_{i} +  \epsilon_{i}
$$

In summary, each species gets it's own intercept, but still has a common slope for Sepal length. 

$$
y_{i.setosa} = -1.70 + 0.632(Sepal.Length_{i}) \\
y_{i.versicolor} = (-1.70 + 2.21) + 0.632(Sepal.Length_{i}) \longrightarrow 0.51 + 0.632(Sepal.Length_{i})\\
y_{i.virginica} = (-1.70 + 3.09) + 0.632(Sepal.Length_{i}) \longrightarrow 1.39 + 0.632(Sepal.Length_{i}) \\
$$

 
Let's look interpret the regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals from the main effects model again. 

```{r}
lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Species, data=iris) |> tbl_regression()
```

* $b_{1}$: After controlling for species, Petal length significantly increases with the length of the sepal (0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.72, p<.0001). 
* $b_{2}$: _Versicolor_ has on average 2.2cm longer petal lengths compared to _setosa_ (95% CI 2.1-2.3, p<.0001). 
* $b_{3}$: _Virginica_ has on average 3.1cm longer petal lengths compared to _setosa_ (95% CI 2.9-3.3, p<.0001). 

> Beta coefficients for categorical variables are always interpreted as the difference between that particular level and the reference group



## Interactions {#interactions}

In this _main effects_ model, Species only changes the intercept. The effect of species is not multiplied by Sepal length. Reviewing the scatterplot below, do you think this is a reasonable model to fit the observed relationship?

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```



If we care about how species _changes_ the relationship between petal and sepal length, we can fit a model with an **interaction** between sepal length ($x_{1}$) and species. For this first example let $x_{2}$ be an indicator for when `species == setosa`. Note that both _main effects_ of sepal length, and setosa species are also included in the model. Interactions are mathematically represented as a multiplication between the two variables that are interacting. 

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \beta_{3}x_{1i}x_{2i}$$

If we evaluate this model for both levels of $x_{2}$, the resulting models are the same as the stratified models. 

When $x_{2} = 0$, the record is on an iris not from the _setosa_ species. 

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}(0) + \beta_{3}x_{1i}(0)$$
which simplifies to 
$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i}$$

When $x_{2} = 1$, the record is on an iris of the _setosa_ species. 

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}(1) + \beta_{3}x_{1i}(1)$$
which simplifies to
$$ Y_{i} \sim (\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})x_{i}$$

Each subgroup model has a different intercept and slope, but we had to estimate 4 parameters in the interaction model, and 6 for the fully stratified model. 

### Fitting interaction models & interpreting coefficients
Interactions are fit in `R` by simply multiplying `*` the two variables together in the model statement. 
```{r}
iris$setosa <- ifelse(iris$Species == "setosa", 1, 0)
lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + setosa + Sepal.Length*setosa, data=iris) |> tbl_regression()
```

The coefficient $b_{3}$ for the interaction term is significant, confirming that species changes the relationship between sepal length and petal length. Thus, species is a **moderator** (Chapter \@ref(mod-strat)).
 
**Interpreting Coefficients**

* If $x_{2}=0$, then the effect of $x_{1}$ on $Y$ simplifies to: $\beta_{1}$
    * $b_{1}$ The effect of sepal length on petal length **for non-setosa species of iris** (`setosa=0`) 
    * For non-setosa species, the petal length increases 1.03cm for every additional cm of sepal length. 
* If $x_{2}=1$, then the effect of $x_{1}$ on $Y$ model simplifies to: $\beta_{1} + \beta_{3}$
    * For setosa species, the petal length increases by `1.03-0.9=0.13` cm for every additional cm of sepal length. 

```{block2,  type='rmdcaution'}
The main effects ($b_{1}$, $b_{2}$) cannot be interpreted by themselves when there is an interaction in the model.
```

### Categorical Interaction variables

Let's up the game now and look at the full interaction model with a categorical version of species. 
Recall $x_{1}$ is Sepal Length, $x_{2}$ is the indicator for _versicolor_, and $x_{3}$ the indicator for _virginica_ . Refer to \@ref(cat-predictors) for information on how to interpret categorical predictors as main effects. 

$$ Y_{i} \sim \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}x_{2i} + \beta_{3}x_{3i} + \beta_{4}x_{1i}x_{2i} + \beta_{5}x_{1i}x_{3i}+\epsilon_{i}$$

```{r}
summary(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Species + Sepal.Length*Species, data=iris))
```

The slope of the relationship between sepal length and petal length is calculated as follows, for each species:   

* _setosa_ $(x_{2}=0, x_{3}=0): b_{1}=0.13$ 
* _versicolor_ $(x_{2}=1, x_{3}=0): b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{4} = 0.13+0.55 = 0.68$
* _virginica_ $(x_{2}=0, x_{3}=1): b_{1} + b_{3} + b_{5} = 0.13+0.62 = 0.75$

Compare this to the estimates gained from the stratified model: 

```{r}
by(iris, iris$Species, function(x){
  lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data=x) %>% coef()
})
```

They're the same! Proof that an interaction is equivalent to stratification. 

### Example 2

What if we now wanted to include other predictors in the model? How does sepal length relate to petal length after controlling for petal width? We add the variable for petal width into the model

```{r}
summary(lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + setosa + Sepal.Length*setosa + Petal.Width, data=iris))
```

So far, petal width, and the combination of species and sepal length are both significantly associated with petal length. 

_Note of caution: Stratification implies that the stratifying variable interacts with all other variables._ 
So if we were to go back to the stratified model where we fit the model of petal length on sepal length AND petal width, stratified by species, we would  be implying that species interacts with both sepal length and petal width. 

E.g. the following stratified model 

* $Y = A + B + C + D + C*D$, when D=1
* $Y = A + B + C + D + C*D$, when D=0

is the same as the following interaction model: 

* $Y = A + B + C + D + A*D + B*D + C*D$



### Example 3: 

Let's explore the relationship between income, employment status and depression. 
This example follows a logistic regression example from section \@ref(mlogreg). 

Here I create the binary indicators of `lowincome` (annual income <$10k/year) and underemployed (part time or unemployed).

```{r}
depress$lowincome <- ifelse(depress$income < 10, 1, 0)
table(depress$lowincome, depress$income, useNA="always")

depress$underemployed <- ifelse(depress$employ %in% c("PT", "Unemp"), 1, 0 )
table(depress$underemployed, depress$employ, useNA="always")
```

The **Main Effects** model assumes that the effect of income on depression is independent of employment status, and the effect of employment status on depression is independent of income. 

```{r}
me_model <- glm(cases ~ lowincome + underemployed, data=depress, family="binomial")
summary(me_model)
```

To formally test whether an interaction term is necessary, we add the interaction term into the model and assess whether the coefficient for the interaction term is significantly different from zero. 
```{r}
me_intx_model <- glm(cases ~ lowincome + underemployed + lowincome*underemployed, data=depress, family="binomial") 
summary(me_intx_model)
```


## Wald test (General F) {#general-F}

The Wald test is used for simultaneous tests of $Q$ variables in a model. This is used primarily in two situations: 

1. Testing if a categorical variable (with more than 2 levels) as a whole improves model fit
2. Testing a linear combination of predictors (such as a difference of differences). _This topic is not discussed yet_

Consider a model with $P$ variables and you want to test if $Q$ additional variables are useful.   

* $H_{0}: Q$ additional variables are useless, i.e., their $\beta$'s all = 0  
* $H_{A}: Q$ additional variables are useful to explain/predict $Y$

The traditional test statistic that we've seen since Intro stats is
$\frac{\hat{\theta}-\theta}{\sqrt{Var(\hat{\theta})}}$

The Wald test generalizes this test _any_ linear combination of predictors. 

$$
(R\hat{\theta}_{n}-r)^{'}[R({\hat{V}}_{n}/n)R^{'}]^{-1}
(R\hat{\theta}_{n}-r)
\quad \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}}  \quad F(Q,n-P)
$$

Where $\mathbf{R}$ is the vector of coefficients for the $\beta$, and $\hat{V}_{n}$ is a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix. Instead of a normal distribution, this test statistic has an $F$ distribution with $Q$ and $n-P$ degrees of freedom. 

In the case where we're testing $\beta_{p}=\beta_{q}=...=0$, $\mathbf{R}$ is all 1's. 


##### Example: Employment status on depression score
Consider a model to predict depression using age, employment status and whether or not the person was chronically ill in the past year as covariates. This example uses the cleaned depression data set.

```{r}
employ.depression.model <- lm(cesd ~ age + chronill + employ, data=depress)
tbl_regression(employ.depression.model)
```

The results of this model show that age and chronic illness are statistically associated with CESD (each p<.006). However employment status shows mixed results. Some employment statuses are significantly different from the reference group, some are not. So overall, is employment status associated with depression? 

Recall that employment is a categorical variable, and all the coefficient estimates shown are the effect of being in that income category has on depression _compared to_ being employed full time. For example, the coefficient for PT employment is greater than zero, so they have a higher CESD score compared to someone who is fully employed. 

But what about employment status overall? Not all employment categories are significantly different from FT status. To test that employment status affects CESD we need to do a global test that all $\beta$'s related to employment status are 0. 


$H_{0}: \beta_{3} = \beta_{4} = \beta_{5} = \beta_{6} = \beta_{7} = \beta_{8} = 0$  
$H_{A}$: At least one $\beta_{j}$ is not 0. 

The `regTermTest` function can be found in the `survey` package. The `survey` package has functions that tend to conflict with `dplyr`, so it is recommended that you don't load the package entirely, and use `::` notation to call the function directly. 

```{r}
survey::regTermTest(employ.depression.model, "employ")
```

* Confirm that the degrees of freedom are correct. It should equal the # of categories in the variable you are testing, minus 1. 
    - Employment has 7 levels, so $df=6$. 
    - Or equivalently, the degrees of freedom are the number of $beta$'s you are testing to be 0. 
    
The p-value of this Wald test is significant, thus employment significantly predicts CESD score.

![q](images/q.png) What does the vector of coefficients $R$ look like here? 



## Multicollinearity

* Occurs when some of the X variables are highly intercorrelated.
* Affects estimates and their SE's (p. 143)
* Look at tolerance, and its inverse, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
* Need tolerance < 0.01, or VIF > 100.

```{r}
big.pen.model <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm, data=pen) 
performance::check_collinearity(big.pen.model) |> plot()
```

* Solution: use variable selection to delete some X variables.
* Alternatively, use dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Components (Chaper @\ref(pca)).


## Variable Selection Process

> Ref: PMA6 CH 9

Variable selection methods such as the ones described in this section, are most often used when performing an _Exploratory_ analysis, where many independent variables have been measured, but a final model to explain the variability of a dependent variable has not yet been determined. 

When building a model, we want to choose a set of independent variables that both will yield a good prediction using as few variables as possible (_parsimony_). We also need to consider controlling for moderators and confounders. In many situations where regression is used, the investigator has strong justification for including certain variables in the model.

* previous studies
* accepted theory

The investigator may have prior justification for using certain variables but may be open to suggestions for the remaining variables.

The set of independent variables can be broken down into logical subsets

1. **Factors of primary interest**. (such as an exposure or treatment)
2. **Potential confounders**. These are measures that could be associated with both the response, and explanatory variables, and which could _explain_ the relationship between the primary factor of interest and the outcome. These are typically a set of demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, and tend to be factors found to be important in prior studies. 
3. **Effect Modifiers (Moderators)**. A set of variables that other studies have shown to change or affect the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. 
4. **Precision variables (covariates)**. Variables associated with the dependent variable, but not the primary factor of interest. 
  

How variables are chosen for inclusion into a model is heavily driven by the purpose of the model: 

* descriptive
* predictive 


### Automated selection procedures


_Forward selection_: Variables are added one at a time until optimal model reached. 

1. Choose the variable with the highest absolute correlation $\mid r \mid$ with the outcome.
2. Choose the next variable that maximizes the model adjusted $R^{2}$. 
3. Repeat until adding additional variables does not improve the model fit significantly. 

_Backward elimination_: Variables are removed one at a time until optimal model reached

1. Put all variables into the model. 
2. Remove the least useful variable in the model. This can be done by choosing the variable with the largest $p$-value. 
3. Repeat until removing additional variables reduces the model fit significantly. 


_Stepwise selection_: Combination of forward and backward. 

0. Start with no variables (just $\bar{Y}$)
1. Add the variable that results in the greatest improvement in model fit. 
2. Add another variable that results in the greatest improvement in model fit after controlling for the first. 
3. Check to see if removing any variable currently in the model improves the fit. 
4. Add another variable...
5. Check to remove variables...
6. Repeat until no variables can be added or removed. 

Most programs have the option to **force** variables to be included in the model. This is important in cases where there is a primary factor of interest such as a treatment effect. 


```{block2,  type='rmdcaution'}
Automated versions of variable selection processes should not be used blindly. 
```

Warnings: 

* Stopping criteria and algorithm can be different for different software programs. 
* Can reject perfectly plausible models from later consideration
* Hides relationships between variables (X3 is added and now X1 is no longer significant. X1 vs X3 should be looked at)


_Best Subsets_

* Select one X with highest simple $r$ with Y
* Select two X’s with highest multiple $r$ with Y
* Select three X’s with highest multiple $r$ with Y
etc.
* Compute adjusted R2, AIC or BIC each time.
* Compare and choose among the "best subsets" of various sizes.

### Lasso

**L**east **A**bsolute **S**hrinkage and **S**election **O**perator.

Goal is to minimize

$$
RSS + \lambda \sum_{j}\mid \beta_{j} \ \mid
$$

where $\lambda$ is a model complexity penalty parameter. 

* Used during cross-validation and AIC/BIC
* "Shrinks" the coefficients, setting some to exactly 0. 

```{block2,  type='rmdnote'}
Appropriate inference after model selection is currently under research. No unifying theory exists yet. 
```

* For now, use lasso to choose variables, then fit a model with only those selected variables in the final model. 
* Variables chosen in this manner are important, yet biased estimates. 



## Comparing between models {#model-fit-criteria}

The goal: Find the subset of independent variables that optimizes (either minimize or maximize) a certain criteria. In other words, the goal is to find the optimal model. 

![q](images/q.png) How do we measure "optimal"? 


First we need to look at two quantities: 

### RSS: Residual Sum of Squares

Recall the method of least squares introduced in section \@ref(mlr) minimies the residual sum of squares around the regression plane. This value is central to all following model comparison. How ``far away" are the model estimates from the observed? 

$$
\sum(Y - \bar{Y})^{2}(1-R^{2})  
$$


### Likelihood function

What is the likelihood that we observed the data $x$, given parameter values $\theta$. 
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x)=p_{\theta }(x)=P_{\theta }(X=x)
$$

* For strictly convenient mathematical matters, we tend to work with the **log-likelihood** (LL).  
* Great because $log$ is a monotonic increasing function, maximizing the LL = maximizing the likelihood function.  
* We can compare between models using functions based off the LL. 

----

There are several measures we can use to compare between competing models. 

### General F Test

Two nested models are similar if the p-value for the General F-test is non-significant at a .15 level.


### Multiple $R^{2}$
If the model explains a large amount of variation in the outcome that's good right? So we could consider using $R^{2}$ as a selection criteria and trying to find the model that maximizes this value. 


* Problem: The multiple $R^{2}$ _always_ increases as predictors are added to the model. 
    - Ex. 1: N = 100, P = 1, E($R^{2}$) = 0.01
    - Ex. 2: N = 21, P = 10, E($R^{2}$) = 0.5
* Problem: $R^{2} = 1-\frac{Model SS}{Total SS}$ is biased: If population $R^{2}$ is really zero, then E($R^{2}$) = P/(N-1). 


### Adjusted $R^{2}$
To alleviate bias use Mean squares instead of SS. 

$R^{2} = 1-\frac{Model MS}{Total MS}$

equivalently, 

$R^{2}_{adj} = R^{2} - \frac{p(1-R^{2})}{n-p-1}$

Now Adjusted $R^{2}$ is approximately unbiased and won't inflate as $p$ increases. 

### Mallows $C_{p}$

$$
    C_{p} = (N-P-1)\left(\frac{RMSE}{\hat{\sigma}^{2}} -1 \right) + (P+1)
$$

where $RMSE = \frac{RSS}{N-P-1}$. 

* Smaller is better
* When all variables are chosen, $P+1$ is at it's maximum but the other part of $C_{p}$ is zero since $RMSE$==$\hat{\sigma}^{2}$


### Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

* A penalty is applied to the deviance that increases as the number of parameters $p$ increase. 
* Tries to find a parsimonious model that is closer to the “truth”.  
* Uses an information function, e.g., the likelihood function $(LL)$.

$$ AIC = -2LL + 2p$$

* Smaller is better
* Can also be written as a function of the residual sum of squares (RSS) (in book)
* Estimates the information in one model _relative to other models_
    - So if all models suck, your AIC will just tell you which one sucks less. 
* Built in `AIC()` function in R
* Rule of thumb: Model 1 and Model 2 are considered to have significantly different fit if the difference in AIC values is greater than 2. 

$$\mid AIC_{1} - AIC_{2}\mid > 2$$


### Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

* Similar to AIC. 
* Built in `BIC()` function in R
* Tries to find a parsimonious model that is more likely to be the “truth”. The smaller BIC, the better.

$$ BIC = -2LL + ln(N)*(P+1)$$ 


### AIC vs BIC

* Both are “penalized likelihood” functions
* Each = -2log likelihood + penalty
* AIC: penalty = 2, BIC: penalty = ln(N)
* For any N > 7, ln(N) > 2
* Thus, BIC penalizes larger models more heavily.
* They often agree.
    - When they disagree, AIC chooses a larger model than BIC.

## General Advice

* Model selection is not a hard science. 
* Some criteria have "rules of thumb" that can guide your exploration (such as difference in AIC < 2)
* _**Use common sense**_: A sub-optimal subset may make more sense than optimal one
* p-values: When you compare two criteria, often the difference has a known distribution. 
    - Wald F Test, the difference in RSS between the two models has a F distribution.
* All criterion should be used as guides.
* Perform multiple methods of variable selection, find the commonalities. 
* Let science and the purpose of your model be your ultimate guide
    - If the purpose of the model is for explanation/interpretation, error on the side of parsimony (smaller model) than being overly complex. 
    - If the purpose is prediction, then as long as you're not overfitting the model (as checked using cross-validation techniques), use as much information as possible. 


## What to watch out for
* Multicollinearity
* Missing Data
* Use previous research as a guide
* Variables not included can bias the results
* Significance levels are only a guide
* Perform model diagnostics after selection to check model fit.
